README

I‚Äôll admit, the break-in footage located within this folder isn‚Äôt the best.
(See semifinal folder for best version of it) However, it is the best
footage I have been able to get of them in my home thus far, I only got it
because it was so well hidden and because the intruders did not have
previous knowledge of this particular camera in this case. (That particular
camera wasn‚Äôt in my amazon purchase history) This is therefore the first
video I‚Äôve gotten that the intruder‚Äôs organized crime gang haven‚Äôt been
able to delete all traces of. However I will say I am working on trying to
recover some of the deleted videos from cameras that were better
positioned, I‚Äôll reach back out to you guys if I am able to successfully do
so.

As for where I was when they broke in, it was between October 25, 2021 and
October 29, 2021, they broke in at least 3 separate times. I only ever left
for a maximum of like 2-3 hours or so at a time. One of the times I went to
home depot for instance--which just shows how sophisticated an operation
this is. I‚Äôd like to do the final video of this hidden camera break-in
footage in a way which proves that they would have to have had advanced
insight into all my day-to-day operations to even have a chance at pulling
this off in the way they did. (i.e. that proves that hackers and others
were indeed involved) Plus--they broke-in numerous times. They always
delete all of my other better positioned videos. They always try to
discredit me. And they always rub it in afterwards.
Security Cameras

Other video cameras that have no trace of these people ever being in my
house:

2 Ring Videodoorbell Video Cameras - I suspect videos deleted by hackers

3 Arlo Video Cameras - I suspect videos deleted by hackers

3 Lorex cameras unplugged due to them I suspect being hacked through that
nvrs wifi capabilities

3 Reolink cameras unplugged due to them I suspect adding some electronic
bug to the nvr or something when they were in my house the last time which
made them able to view/control them remotely, the last time I reported a
break-in

‚Äî‚Äî-

1 hidden camera is all that remained which they didn‚Äôt have prior knowledge
of.

How They Broke In

As for how they broke in this series of break ins--I suspect they broke in
first through my garage by stealing my garage door opener during the eagles
incident I reported previously, when they broke into my car and poisoned me
there. And then they also broke in through my front door this last time by
picking/bumping my locks; once I realized my garage door opener was missing
I disabled it. In the past, they have also been able to break-in to my car,
which has a digital key, hotel rooms, (either by hacking the marriott or by
brute forcing the electronic key) I suspect they got in my safe this last
time, they‚Äôve broken into my home numerous times now in numerous different
ways, etc, etc. They are very sophisticated and technologically advanced
indeed. I am happy to elaborate on how I know this if you‚Äôd like.

Motive

As for my brother‚Äôs motive, it‚Äôs either money reasons, either via my own
personal trust not being set up correctly, (or via some secret life
insurance policy he may have pulled out on me)--or it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a first
hand witness simply by being there for both my father‚Äôs and sister‚Äôs deaths
and seeing how he treated my sister Karie on her deathbed and talking to
him about it thereafter. I guess there could be a jealousy component to it
as well. If you want to dig deeper on all this, when you‚Äôve got a lot of
time, you can look into this other google drive folder i‚Äôve aggregated over
time. It‚Äôs pretty unstructured and large right now, I still need to create
a simplified timeline of it, but I have shared the following google drive
folder with you guys previously.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HVVndeMbrKuNdTOIp39iaTPXBWY-8QrM?usp=sharing
(Don‚Äôt focus on all that right now though--focus on this latest series of
break-ins in this google drive folder right now please‚Äîjust know what I
have alleged has been consistent and if anything it‚Äôs been verified over
time)

Nobody seems to know who detective Joseph Escobar is btw, which i find
really odd. He‚Äôs the detective I spoke to originally starting around
September 16, 2021 for weeks having to do with all the EMF stuff. (435)
757-5922

So just to be clear, they have broken into my house a lot more than what‚Äôs
shown in this hidden camera footage, I just finally put a hidden camera up
because I was getting so frustrated with them always breaking in and
deleting/disabling all of my other camera‚Äôs videos.

Please just give me the benefit of doubt and save all of the evidence for
the future, at least until we can figure out what to test everything for
exactly.

Radiation poisoning is something my doctor has actually been considering
diagnosing me with lately tbh, after all of the EMF stuff, so I don‚Äôt know
if we could test for that at some point or not? Feel free to contact my
doctor for more information. (See original email for contact information)


I‚Äôve done everything the police have requested of me--and then some. I‚Äôve
got psych tested. I‚Äôve went to the doctor numerous times. I‚Äôve gotten an
MRI. I‚Äôve went to counselors--and the result is I‚Äôm perfectly sane. I‚Äôve
even got hidden video camera footage now. Can you please now begin to truly
take all this seriously and help bring all this to an end--pretty
please? Bottom
line is this is not a medical issue--it is very much an organized crime
issue. Once you start looking at it all from the perspective I‚Äôve laid out
then it actually begins to make a whole lot of sense--more sense than
anything tbh.

I‚Äôm still working on a fully edited version of these break-in videos with
callouts and time passed callouts and pointing out each individual break-in
and each intruder, etc, so that it is all fully comprehensible and linked
to references from other cameras of exact timing. And I‚Äôd like to do it all
in a short and easy to consume manner which I plan to then post to the ring
video doorbell neighbor‚Äôs app to notify all of my neighbors.

In the captured hidden camera videos, take a look at how sophisticated and
disciplined the intruders are. They don‚Äôt even speak for instance--they
must just strictly communicate over some encrypted messaging app or
something. Notice how they broke in 3 separate times--while I was only just
in town for a bit. Think about what information they‚Äôd have to have on me
in order to even have a chance at pulling that off successfully--and
repeatedly. Think about the fact that they tried making it appear as though
they didn‚Äôt even break in.

The motive to break-ins matters--it can even lead you to create a criminal
profile based on a book I‚Äôve read. And in this case their motive appears to
be quite sinister from what evidence I have found. Especially when paired
with everything else I‚Äôve reported.

I estimate there were at least 6 people involved in each of these
break-ins, more like 9 people tbh, but I‚Äôm being conservative. ~3 people in
my house, ~3 people posted up in strategic locations in their cars looking
out on behalf of the intruders for the coast to be clear outside--despite
my neighbors being on high alert, and then ~3 hackers monitoring my
location in town, deleting my cloud videos, remotely toggling on and off
various things for the intruders, etc, etc. I say this based on past
experiences with this organized crime group. Their motive must be huge to
warrant that many resources in my opinion.

I suspect these guys put poison in my vape juice btw. (Just hear me out--it
was likely some poison bought off of the dark web--which anyone can buy
mind you--there seems to be a societal stigma against poisons--which is
exactly why I suspect they have been so effective for my brother--and if it
is true, people who poison people often end up killing quite a few people
before they are ever caught (like up to 60 or more) --
https://www.ranker.com/list/serial-killers-who-used-poison/ranker-crime --
There might even be a life insurance component to it -- I dunno if you guys
can look up any and all life insurance policies in my name?) The vape juice
poisoning could actually result in me getting lung cancer or something.
Then I receive voicemail messages from a repeat voicemail leaver with heavy
breathing right around the same time, etc--as if to mock me for them
putting something in my vape juice. My brother even vaped before I did‚Äîit‚Äôs
messed up. But yea, it‚Äôs organized crime‚Äîthat‚Äôs what organized crime people
do. See the videos. (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1at0y7dezVZcBkW9Tkm9vqTX8LbTaG6Uh/view?usp=drivesdk
)

I suspect they also tampered with my prescriptions using what I suspect to
be similar poisons bought off the dark web. (The poisons are an educated
guess of mine based on the look, smell, taste, and how they‚Äôve made me feel
after--despite being on my prescriptions and vape juice and whatnot
consistently for years. I actually know it‚Äôs some type of poison based on
the first few times they did it, when they used to do it externally more
than anything. Those definitely seemed like they had to be some type of
poison. They seemed like engineered to like soak into your skin and not
wash off, etc. Also based on my brother showing me the dark web previously
and my brother showing me and some friends how you can buy drugs and hitmen
on the dark web, telling us how secure it was, etc, around the time my
sister Karie passed away in December of 2015, etc)

I suspect they also rigged my water heater with one of their electronic
bugs too this last time to make it so it could essentially boil over and
explode on their command while they were in my house‚Äîthat‚Äôs where you see
the intruders in 2 of the clips--and/or so they could gas me in my house
after I turned the pilot light off after having discovered it. This is
actually a pattern--they did something very similar to my furnace the last
break-in I reported‚Äîthey rigged it so they could gas me. And they rigged my
electricity to emf me previously. (See Screen Shot 2021-11-08 at 5.26.05

and
https://drive.google.com/file/d/17gXvInIwXC6I4Uv8ByWgL0F3A82jxM\_V/view?usp=sharing
)

I suspect they‚Äôve rigged my whole house with electronic bugs--both inside
and outside--all meant to I suspect either find out more information on me
or to aid in killing me. (Either that or it‚Äôs all external or in my attic
or the bugs were placed in existing electronics when they were in my house
previously)

Information is power. Ignorance is bliss. Just sayin.

I have finally about secured the funding to hire a professional bug sweeper
I think. I‚Äôll keep you posted once I do hire somebody to bug sweep my
house. It‚Äôs quite expensive tbh.

Also just please recognize the fact that these guys constantly try to make
me look bad and/or discredit me--and that they have already corrupted
people through all of their hacking who will also try and make me look bad
or discredit me I have found; or else cover for them. But make no mistake
what is really going on--they are and have been trying to kill me I suspect
and get away with it for some time now--all to protect their leader from me
testifying against him about how I suspect he may have done similar things
to my father and sister--who are now dead btw. (Their leader being my
brother, Dustin Bay, I suspect) My brother denies it, but it‚Äôs the cold
hard truth--he‚Äôs demonstrated that to me numerous times now. Partly via
‚Äúsignals‚Äù he sends and partly direct communications or indirect
communications. They enjoy letting their victims know who is
responsible--it‚Äôs their kryptonite. My kryptonite is my love for my brother
tbh‚Äîdespite him trying to kill me. My brother is very good at psychology
and manipulation as well btw. He‚Äôs also very skilled at premeditating any
given situation it seems.

My brother is the most secure person in terms of security I‚Äôve ever known.
He‚Äôs also one of the smartest people I‚Äôve ever known. Therefore this is a
complex case with no smoking guns in sight. So proving all this is indeed
my brother orchestrating everything behind the scenes--might prove
extremely difficult.

When you think about it; the way they are going about doing all this might
actually be one of the smartest ways to kill somebody and get away with it.
Plausible deniability and using weapons that can‚Äôt easily be proven as
weapons in an attack. And fine tuning the exact means to the individual so
that their death appears natural, and hiring multiple people to be in on
the attack‚Äîwhile maintaining a distance yourself‚Äînow what could be scarier
than that?

As for me, I‚Äôm a senior software engineer so I know computers and
technology pretty well myself and even still--these guys have proven they
can hack literally anything and everything over and over again--and they
can hack my whole house and turn it into a giant death trap without my
consent. (See Credentials section below for more on my credentials) Again
there‚Äôs no smoking gun--yet--but just try living all of this yourself, it‚Äôs
not my prescriptions, I‚Äôve been on the same dose for some time and I‚Äôve
gone without to rule them out and I am quitting them just so they can‚Äôt use
them against me anymore. These guys are just extremely sophisticated and
their end game is to kill me and get away with it. So of course they are
going to deny it and try and smear campaign me--even though they are way
worse than me at everything they accuse me of.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a prank either; that‚Äôs way too much money and resources
devoted to me daily for months on end just for a prank and I still don‚Äôt
know what the hell substances they are using to make me feel that way and
at the end of the day they are still breaking the law and making me feel
like they are trying to kill me‚Äîat the very least. They may have already
succeeded we just don‚Äôt know it yet‚Äîthat‚Äôs what is so scary. Plus, I feel
like I could have died multiple times now if I hadn‚Äôt been so vigilant--I
feel I‚Äôve been to within inches of my life at times‚Äîwhat kind of prank is
that? The poisonings are very real, some even pull all my blood from my
extremities. Others make my lymph nodes hurt for days. Others make me feel
wobbly. Others seem to be meant to like discredit me. They seem to use
different kinds of poisons meant to do different things. And they have
adamantly tried to make me like deemed crazy or something--it‚Äôs not a
prank. Even though sometimes I wish it was all a prank because I really do
love my brother and I really don‚Äôt want to lose any more family members.

Imagine you being in my shoes. You‚Äôve lost half your family. Your brother
has completely ripped your family apart--on both sides. And now he and his
new ‚Äúpeople‚Äù constantly make it clear to you that they want you dead--that
they are indeed the ones responsible--all the while engineering all their
attacks to try and discredit you and make you look crazy--and they even do
stuff like call you constantly to rub it in afterwards, etc.

It‚Äôs a mix between psychological warfare and repeated attempted murder in
my opinion‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt going to stop until they succeed btw. Just imagine
if they get away with all this. How would you feel if you were me? I
imagine you‚Äôd feel not very well, like you have let down your family, etc,
if you can‚Äôt get the police to actually believe you and take you seriously.
You‚Äôd feel extremely concerned about the rest of your living family as
well.

If you guys don‚Äôt take me seriously, just imagine how much more carnage
these guys will be able to cause going forward--most people aren‚Äôt nearly
as technologically adept as I am and most people would have no idea who is
ultimately behind all this like I do.


As for how hacked I am--the hackers have RAT viruses on all my devices. So
they are able to access anything I am able to access--and then
some--whenever my devices are turned on. Any accounts I‚Äôm logged into they
are able to access. I know this from being hacked for so long and from
being a senior software engineer myself, I‚Äôve been able to narrow it down
over time. These guys are extremely good at hacking--I‚Äôve even suspected
they tried hacking you guys--the Logan City Police Department and/or the
Cache County Sheriff's Office recently. (Not sure if they succeeded or
not--but if they did then it doesn‚Äôt bode well for me) I noticed you guys
always seem to call on restricted numbers nowadays which is a good thing in
my opinion, it means you guys listened. I suspect these guys will even go
so far as to hack everyone around me to try and intimidate them into not
helping me. (Whether they realize it or not yet) You‚Äôd be surprised how
good these guys are at hacking and intimidation and how much hackers in
general can interfere with your life--our lives are extremely digital these
days. All it takes is one or two exploits purchased off of the dark web and
a motive to do some serious damage to a lot of people. A lot of corruption
is rooted in hacking btw. The fact that they haven‚Äôt corrupted me after
being on all my devices for so long should speak volumes about me.

My father, Tim Gibbons, used to be a huge supporter of the police
departments around Logan UT. Since this latest push from my brother to tear
down everything my father has built started, including by killing anyone in
his way, including and especially me, I have also rearranged my whole trust
to make it so Cache County Sheriff's Office, Department of Public Safety -
Cyber Division, and the LDS church are some of the beneficiaries on my own
personal trust so that if my brother is able to succeed in killing me,
hopefully you all can continue the fight to make Logan a safer place to
live with my money after I‚Äôm gone. (~$115,000/ea) Because I‚Äôm completely
outnumbered here. Those are the entities I feel have been the most helpful
throughout all of this. I‚Äôd prefer not to have to die to make these
donations however. But I realize investigating all of this isn‚Äôt cheap.
(See Amendment Nov 12, 2021 below)

At the end of the day I‚Äôm just hoping you guys will continue to aggregate
and document all of the evidence I have been able to actually acquire
throughout all of this, and more than anything--I hope you guys will
continue to give me the benefit of doubt.

My brother is a lot more powerful than I am. But what I have that he
doesn‚Äôt have is I am a very humble honest person, and I ultimately have the
truth on my side. I have no motive for turning my brother in other than him
endlessly and relentlessly coming after me--people get killed for money
reasons and/or being witnesses all of the time.

If you think about it, everything I have reported thus far has actually
lined up really freaking well since the very beginning--regardless of how
outlandish it may seem. It‚Äôs all designed to appear to make me look crazy
or to be outlandish for a reason--to give these guys the advantage in
killing me. I just report what I see. Thus far though I‚Äôve felt like it‚Äôs
mostly been up to me to prove all of this, which just shouldn‚Äôt be the way
it is supposed to be. Feel free to speak to my work or my doctor‚Äôs office
if you have any further questions on my credibility. But I‚Äôll tell you
right now that my brother is like five steps ahead of you guys, he‚Äôs tried
killing me so many times now and discrediting me so many times now for a
reason--because I‚Äôm the one person who could actually testify against him
and get him locked up for all the carnage he‚Äôs caused over his lifetime.

Killers are driven by all the dominance, power, and control more than
anything from what I read. It‚Äôs the only thing that makes them feel
anything at all. These people have definitely dominated and controlled me
lately.

Daily Occurrences
As of Nov 12, 2021

I believe my brother‚Äôs motive might also be as outlined below, I just
discovered it when talking to a legit trust lawyer for the first time
today. (November 12, 2021) Essentially my personal trust referenced above
could actually be invalid at this time. It was originally set up by my
accountant, Paul Gibbons, which is not usually done by an accountant. But
that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Paul‚Äôs intentions were nefarious, but with
how good my brother is at hacking and considering Paul was a lot more
lenient on Dusty taking out money than he ever was on I or my little sister
Taylor--who the hell knows at this point--Paul being a stickler with my
little sister Taylor and I could also be a good thing I guess? I just don‚Äôt
want to die without even being able to enjoy hardly any of my inheritance
is all. It sucks when Paul is strict especially when my life is in danger.
But I feel my brother could have easily corrupted/intimidated a lot of the
people around me through hacking and through his organized crime operation
to say the least. (Where there is a will‚Äîthere is a way‚Äîand my brother
definitely has the will to kill me that‚Äôs for sure‚Äîhe‚Äôs spent the last 3
years of his life completely devoted to just that pretty much--he doesn‚Äôt
even have a real job) Do I think it will stop once I do get my estate in
order‚Äîno I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôve been trying to kill me if not daily than weekly
for months now‚Äîand they tried killing me at least twice before this year
starting in 2019. If anything, this new news might just further incentivize
them to hurry.

Moral of the story is Dusty‚Äôs might also be incentivized to kill me even
more now that I have found out my trust may be invalid‚Äîjust to burn me‚Äîhe
may or may not have known that all along, which could make it fall back to
my father‚Äôs trust and whereas I don‚Äôt have any kids, all my assets could
potentially end up going back to Dusty and my little sister Taylor if I
were to die before I‚Äôm 35. That‚Äôs my fear at least, so I‚Äôm going to get on
fixing it.

Dusty sent this to me a while ago--it takes on a whole new meaning now.
This could actually be perceived as a threat of dusty saying he‚Äôs going to
kill me btw. And of him admitting to killing our father all wrapped in one.
Cuz it‚Äôs not Dusty‚Äôs money‚Äîit‚Äôs our fathers money. And the only way to have
Paul transfer money out of my account is if I‚Äôm dead. (And/or Paul is
corrupted)

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lKsuVgwIurn8FbpQ1BthGxL1aZiW8XTr/view?usp=sharing
Stuff like this shows you just how far ahead dusty premeditates things.

My brother has given me an indication he‚Äôs now in Russia btw, he could just
be trying to mislead me again tho‚Äîhe lies a lot lately. But the fact that
my brother can remain a threat even if he‚Äôs completely busted for trying to
kill me is partly why I‚Äôve been looking into something like witness
protection lately.

I accidentally left my brand new prescriptions in the car when I went in to
speak to the lawyer just today. (Huge mistake given who I‚Äôm dealing with
and how they constantly break into all my stuff and follow me) I felt them
EMF me just briefly while I was there as well. They seem to like to let me
know when they are around and/or who is responsible. But yea, I‚Äôm now
concerned they could have tampered with my brand new prescriptions as
well‚ÄîI hope not. I kinda have PTSD now as well tbh, they‚Äôve put me through
a lot recently. It‚Äôs partially because they always would take feedback from
what I say to anyone electronically, via all their hacking, and they
fine-tune their attacks each and every time to get better each time. For
instance at first they rigged my furnace to gas me, then I started shutting
the power to my furnace off at night times, then the next time they rigged
my water heater which doesn‚Äôt require power. So now I just anticipate them
continuing to tune their attacks like that at this point. Meaning this next
time it‚Äôs very possible they could make their poison stuff not smell or
taste at all which could make me not notice it early enough. An overall
parttern they‚Äôve followed over time is I suspect they started externally
with external poisons and then moved to internal poisonings overtime, where
I couldn‚Äôt wash it off. (Repeated rinsing with rubbing alcohol was the only
thing I found that could get it off previously, and even then it would
still ooze out of my pours for days) ‚Äî as of 12/20/2021‚Äî I suspect they‚Äôve
now moved back to external poisonings which don‚Äôt wash off with rubbing
alcohol/apple cider vinegar and which aren‚Äôt immediately apparent you‚Äôve
been attacked ‚Äî so a better description of their overall pattern is that
they will always fine tune what they are doing at any given time using all
their intel gleaned through all their hacking. (So what they are doing
constantly changes based on their latest intel‚Äîa lot of times they‚Äôll
change up what they are doing just to try and make me look bad or to try
and make a statement I have made previously prove false, like going back to
external poisonings after I said in general they seem to be going from
external to internal over time) Now that is something I can say
definitively that they won‚Äôt be able to then turn around and try and make
me look bad about, is their methods are always changing based on their
latest intel essentially, to best suit them.. And they constantly exploit
the latest vulnerabilities both in the digital and physical realm.

I hope I‚Äôm wrong on them potentially getting in my car today especially
given the news on my trust possibly being invalid as of this moment‚Äîbut
moral of the story is they aren‚Äôt going to stop until dusty is either
locked up or until they succeed in killing me. (I‚Äôm getting my trust fixed
like as soon as physically possible btw) But just know I‚Äôm now this way for
a reason. Because I‚Äôve been put through a lot--it‚Äôs been the hardest
challenge of my life tbh. And to be perfectly clear--I do feel I am right
on most everything I have alleged, even though sometimes I wish it weren‚Äôt
so, at least everything that has been consistent and that has withstood the
test of time like my brother killing people. But proving it all in full
beyond a reasonable doubt is another story. Again, I don‚Äôt think they are
going to stop until they get caught--I say that with a heavy heart--I‚Äôve
tried everything to get my brother to stop‚Äîincluding offering him one of my
buildings. He seems to just enjoy it or something tbh. He thinks it‚Äôs funny
or something. Plus he seems to have plenty of money himself. He thinks life
is just a big game of intelligence it seems.

His real true motive has to be to prevent me from testifying against him;
cuz when you think about it from his perspective, that‚Äôs the best evidence
on him I‚Äôve got is my first hand witness testimony.

P.s. Dusty has used acid a lot btw, among other drugs. He‚Äôs likely on other
drugs as well now he just lies about it. He used to have headaches all the
time and he said acid was one of the only things that would help with his
headaches. But yea, I fear all the drugs he‚Äôs done may have at least in
part made him not perceive reality correctly; he could have just been born
this way, idk, but with that said he‚Äôs still just as smart as he used to be
and just as capable at pre-meditating things. Only now he seems to only
enjoy hunting people, that‚Äôs the only thing that makes him feel anything at
all it seems.

He‚Äôs never been the best influence on me as my older brother just in
general either. Do I want him to be locked up for life? Not necessarily, I
guess we will see. I can‚Äôt prove the suspected murders by myself anyways. I
can only point out the patterns and correlations and oddities and what all
has happened either directly to me or directly in front of me.

At the end of the day‚ÄîI just want him to stop coming after me--as I‚Äôve said
this whole time. But he‚Äôs made clear to me time and time again‚Äîhe‚Äôs not
going to stop for anything until he succeeds.


As of Nov 15, 2021

The following shortcut got removed from this folder somehow. My brother
like tries to edit anything I do to try and best suit his agenda. He must
of thought this was too advantageous to me or something. He also tries to
do things like force me to quit my job and force me to stop managing my
properties through all his relentless harassment which always intensifies
at night times. He tries to paint a picture of me which isn't accurate
through his never ending harassment to try and discredit me. He wasn‚Äôt able
to corrupt me through hacking so he had to turn to force and torture
instead‚Äîand even then he still can‚Äôt.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jogSrhTuZNKWmC6YO2tiNoUj39lK4myB

This above link and all of it‚Äôs content is ALL ME btw. $60,000+ in revenue
per year and it‚Äôs only November; all those contracts I did myself. All that
property mgmt. Even the fact that I chose the assets I did in the first
place and that I then chose to not sell them and instead rent them out
despite being advised otherwise by my accountant at the time‚Äîthat was all
me too. I do suspect my accountant could be at least partly under my
brother's influence btw. Because a professional bug sweep is the first
logical step to resolve all of this‚Äîand it could even lead to attempted
murder charges if I‚Äôm right about my furnace and water heater being
tampered with‚Äîwhich I do believe I am‚Äîand yet for some reason my accountant
won‚Äôt give me a total of $3500 for even other legitimate causes right now..
Even though I now have the support of doctors, psychiatrists, and hidden
camera footage and even though I couldn‚Äôt even sell my house right now
without disclosing the fact that I suspect there may be electronic bugs in
here. Weird right? That‚Äôs only one example of many as to why my little
sister and I have wanted to switch trustees for a while now; one of the
bigger examples is Paul actually got fired from Jones Simkins for ‚Äúnot
putting his clients interests first‚Äù like a year or so ago now. And that
wasn‚Äôt even the first time we suspected Paul might be corrupt either. Only
now we have a good idea as to who may have corrupted him. The hackers keep
trying to interfere with what I type btw, they do that a lot.

I suspect there‚Äôs electronic bugs in my home and car. The ones in my car
allow them to track my location in town‚Äîeven when I don‚Äôt bring my phone
with me. The ones on my home control my water heater and control some kind
of gas and control my furnace cuz they straight shut off my water heater's
ability to heat this weekend now for a bit, the knob didn‚Äôt even do
anything anymore, as if to punish me or something--after causing it to
almost explode previously‚Äîand they always do it at strategic times too.
Like they mess with my nest thermostat all of the time, and they try and
gas me at strategic times through my HVAC/furnace, (I think they installed
that capability during the October 15, 2021 break-in) and then after I
started shutting the power off to my furnace at nights, to avoid getting
gassed while I was asleep,, they started overriding my heat settings to
make it so it won‚Äôt even heat my house right before bed even though it‚Äôs
supposed to, etc, as if to coerce me to not shut the power to my furnace
off before I go to sleep so that my house will actually heat up; I finally
just resorted to plugging in a space heater in my room tbh.

Plus I‚Äôve suspected there are emf bugs in here and sound causing bugs in
here and location finding bugs in here for some time‚ÄîI deal with them
pretty much every night--especially nights when I have something important
to do the next day like goto the doctor or go to work. They try and make me
look bad to other key people essentially by emf-ing me or infrasounding me
or causing this obnoxious sound that makes your ears ring and gives you a
headache mainly at night times these days. (They used to do it in the day
too) It‚Äôd be nice if we could get a camera facing my house btw, they always
send people out to try and exploit the latest vulnerability given the
latest info they find out through hacking, so they send people out to add
new bugs to my home and or to move them around. I wish I could stop the
hacking then I‚Äôd be set‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt cuz it all has to do with low level
vulnerabilities in like the router and operating system software which I
know very little about‚Äîvulnerabilities that companies like Apple aren‚Äôt
even aware of yet. They take over my router and then they hack my whole
network using some hacking AI essentially, is what I‚Äôve narrowed it down
to. Well that and they can push malicious updates to your phone just by
being in proximity.

Demo of hacking AI that takes over your modem and downloads a new malicious
configuration file which then proceeds to infect the rest of your network:

They literally try and kill me pretty much every single day these days,
whether you hear it from me or not, both with all the electronic bugs and
by breaking into my car, etc, following me to walmart and having these 2
girls who were dressed up all funny clearly to hide their identities dump
this liquid substance on my hoodie‚Äôs hood while walking behind me‚Äîmeant to
get on the back of my neck while i was in there‚Äîwhich it did, etc, etc
(those are just 2 examples in the last 3 days--not to mention all the stuff
they do when they constantly break-in my house--I finally just resorted to
a ton of hidden cameras tbh)‚Äîand then they try and make my life completely
miserable in the meantime in whatever way possible.. It‚Äôs not random‚Äîit‚Äôs
all based on dominance and control and painting a picture like I said. It
always gets better or worse depending on whether I do something my brother
likes or not or whether my brother is throwing something in my face or not.
And he‚Äôs not going to like this.. But it‚Äôs all aimed at ultimately killing
me and getting away with it. It‚Äôs like Charles Manson but times 10 tbh.

I‚Äôve got to figure out what else he‚Äôs changed/removed in here now..

As of Nov 16, 2021

Added my electricity bill summary, added more detailed versions of my
conversations with co-workers, added some more comments on my buildium
property mgmt stuff.

I now have a roll-over will in place that is validated by a legit trust
attorney btw. It rolls everything that I have stake in that is unaccounted
for over to my trust when I die. I‚Äôm a little suspicious as to why my
accountant didn‚Äôt know that trusts require things to be added into them and
therefore in order for the trust he set up for me to be valid with the bulk
of my assets--then my father‚Äôs trust would have essentially had to had been
made to be owned by my own personal trust--which Paul obviously never did
that. And therefore my own personal trust was invalid for all this time.
I‚Äôm a little suspicious as to why Paul didn‚Äôt know that to begin
with--because he should have known that. He actually told me that about my
house needing to be added to it‚ÄîI just figured he was going to take care of
the trust part of it himself somehow. But nope.

My accountant, Paul Gibbons, is a good guy at heart, I think my brother is
just evil as hell and might have corrupted him or something. I wouldn‚Äôt
want to be put through what I‚Äôm going through either if I were a third
party looking in. I can now see how good people can become corrupted
though, in numerous different ways tbh. I think that‚Äôs why I stuck with
Paul for as long as I did though is because I received mixed signals from
him whereas I do think he is more or less a good person at heart. However
then there‚Äôs all the other shady stuff too, which I think at least in part
is my brother or someone exerting corruption onto him. As for my brother, I
mean I used to get the sense he was a good person but not anymore. I
haven‚Äôt gotten that sense for some time now from him.

Working on switching trustees now tbh. We will just have to wait and see
what happens. It was so difficult this last distribution request to get
Paul to approve it despite him acting like he agrees with me about Dusty.
It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm asking my brother for money sometimes it seems.

Oddly enough, the trust lawyer I did end up connecting up with, when going
down the list of trust lawyers in Logan UT, I guess he‚Äôs actually
representing another client in a case against Paul already.

Lastly, I found out my rental house value had legit doubled in value since
my last overall worth calculations. Which if residential real estate is any
indication of how commercial is doing‚ÄîI now believe my trust could be worth
up to $2 million instead of $1 million. Meaning I haven‚Äôt pulled out
anything yet really if you look at it that way‚Äîif anything I‚Äôve made my dad
money. And so again, it‚Äôs odd I face such opposition to such reasonable
distribution requests which could literally be the difference between life
and death for me. I‚Äôve been like just barely getting by this whole time too
because I elected to stay in Logan instead of going to a new job I got an
offer from this last March, the new job paid approximately double what I‚Äôm
making currently. I decided to stay at rent dynamics though partly because
of my employee retainment program vesting in October, which entailed
ownership in a hotel in West Valley that I‚Äôve now procured. And partly
because I was afraid of losing connections and being left more vulnerable
to Dusty.

Which the Dusty part of my calculation definitely ended up coming to
fruition‚Äîstaying at rent dynamics hasn‚Äôt been quite as advantageous as I
thought it might be to combat being more vulnerable to Dusty through my
connections though‚Äîif anything money is turning out to be key‚Äîbecause
everyone seems to just fear retaliation from Dusty after seeing all that he
does to me‚Äîwhich makes it so few are willing to actually help me and it
makes it so I‚Äôd almost prefer others to not get involved for their own
safety. (I don‚Äôt blame them‚Äîit sucks what he is doing to me‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt
even do anything to him) But I just ask people not add to the psychological
warfare/attempted murder campaigns being raged against me.

Anyways, what I‚Äôm getting at is my brother dusty is clearly wealthy as hell
now‚Äîlike it‚Äôs pretty unbelievable tbh. He‚Äôs like rolling in dark money it
seems. And thus far I‚Äôve been completely hamstrung myself in terms of money
in fighting back. Which just puts the advantage that much more on Dusty and
makes it that much harder for me; I hope to fix that part next
however‚Äîbecause I really need at least some money just to keep up with all
his attacks against me, and continue to try and defend against them, etc.
Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll even get enough money to do an electronic bug
sweep‚Äîwhich could change everything tbh.
As of Nov 18, 2021

I‚Äôve now secured the funding for a professional bug sweep scheduled for
Monday.

I am a little concerned they might have gotten in my house again on
November 16th, 2021, having known this.

I suspect they broke into my car today and stole my keys. I suspect it
happened when I was in the Home Depot for only like ten minutes, but yea
they stole my keychain along with all of my keys. (I had two pairs of car
keys on me at the time) I couldn‚Äôt even get back into my house when I
returned home.

As of November 24, 2021

I suspect they locked me out of my 1Password today. Meaning they likely
have access to all of my passwords. Luckily they had already changed up my
2-factor auth settings on my 1Password fairly recently, which I was lucky
enough to find a way around, and so I took a backup of all my passwords at
that time just as a precaution whereas they literally showed me they had
full control of my account at that time pretty much‚Äîin order to be able to
completely invalidate my 2-factor auth settings and swap them out for
something else like that. The only way past it this time however is by
starting a whole new account‚Äîand even then I know I won‚Äôt be able to keep
them out.

As of November 26, 2021

Do you want to know how I know I'm right in all of this? Let me tell you
how. It's because one thing I accuse these guys of always leads to the
next. (It all fits a pattern essentially) For instance, I've been accusing
them of emf-ing me and infrasounding me mainly at night times correct? So I
finally figured out that lead is one of the best ways to stop all that; (
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZKBa9\_C6ZBHi1eUtjAKme6tVSIpj7hMm?usp=sharing)
just like in an X-ray vest--I've already tried everything else pretty much
besides water/concrete, as shown below. (
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZKBa9\_C6ZBHi1eUtjAKme6tVSIpj7hMm?usp=sharing)
So what did I order seems they always specifically try and target my brain
at nights? That's right, I ordered a lead x-ray cap for sleeping to try and
block their attempts at giving me brain cancer. Why are they trying to give
me brain cancer? Because that's a pretty darn good excuse for my brother to
use to dismiss all my allegations against him at a later date, assuming
they fail at getting others to believe it‚Äôs all in my head before then.
Plus I have commented to my brother previously worried about him
potentially having holes in his brain from all the drugs he's done
previously--and he took offense to it--even though I was honestly being
sincere at the time and I was honestly just worried about him needing help
at the time. So them trying to give me brain cancer goes right along with
all that. And if you remember correctly, you'll recall I also told you
these guys stole my keychain out of my car the other day--with all my keys
on it--including my mailbox key. Well guess what is missing today? All my
mail was missing--my mailbox was completely empty and I haven't gotten my
mail for days. This kind of thing is all my brother does in life--he just
tries his best to make others' lives miserable all the time and get away
with it. He plans it all out strategically and it's his day job
essentially--he has no other real job. This is his job. Remember how I said
they always rub it in afterwards? Them stealing my mail now is yet another
form of them rubbing it in. Mail theft is nothing to these guys, nor is
burglary, theft in general, breaking and entering, trespassing, pulling
guns on me, hacking, witness tampering--all that is nothing to them. Which
also shows just how sinister they really are. I personally believe murder
is nothing to them. These guys are seriously no joke at the very least and
I swear to god some of the neighbors are among them‚Äîthe evidence seems to
suggest that. (See kid videos folder, (
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u5IDbtDskD\_X8bowDJAY9ukE-xuI5MlS?usp=sharing
) in addition to them deleting videos of some of the neighbors kids the
night we celebrated Halloween--they deleted the videos which corresponded
to oddities I experienced that night and the next day after having texted
my brother, etc--that child abuser‚Äôs kids were actually the first to come
to my house trick or treating this year--that video is gone as well) I
don't know who they are or what cult they belong to, I have my suspicions,
but all I know is they will lie about their involvement in this like any
good criminal would and I know they are all affiliated with my brother
somehow, my brother Dustin Bay; and I suspect my brother wants me dead cuz
he lets me know in one way or another literally daily.

My other brother Michael Thompson, who has been a cop his whole life,
actually believes me to a certain degree and he actually warned me to be
careful or else I could be held responsible myself. (Which is scary) So I
like have to walk this fine line which isn't easy. All I'm saying is do not
underestimate these guys' abilities and their willingness to do harm to
others. I am working on moving btw like I said however my brother did his
homework prior to coming after me--he hacks everyone around me--which makes
it that much harder for me to go anywhere without them knowing about it.

For instance, my accountant could be hacked as well, I‚Äôm not sure, but if I
wanted to play it safe then it would be wise for me not to go anywhere--at
least until I switch accountants. Also, I find it odd that they haven't
really messed with my house lately but they've messed with literally
everything else away from my house. Like I asked the police to put up a
camera facing my house and I don't know if they did or not. But based on
these guys seemingly staying away from my house lately I'd almost guess
that the police finally did put up a camera somewhere. (But that's just a
guess‚Äîit could be my added protection inside as well which has caused them
to stay away more now) All I'm saying is these guys could even have
advanced insight into what the police are doing even--either through the
neighbors, wittingly or unwittingly through all their hacking, or else
through hacking the police department itself--that's what these guys are
capable of.

These things that have been happening alone that I have been able to
actually prove show a certain level of sophistication. But yea, if anyone
has any advice for me in all of this I'd love to hear it. Because my
options really aren't that great any way you look at it. They use
vulnerabilities that companies like Apple and whatnot don't even know about
yet--meaning it's almost impossible for even senior software engineers like
myself to keep them off my devices--let alone average joes. I initially
felt like my role was to bust my brother and provide enough evidence to
bring him to justice, but I've since realized my best evidence on him is my
first hand witness testimony, and therefore if I really want to ultimately
assist in holding my brother accountable for what he's done to who knows
how many people--I need to stay alive for as long as possible. P.s. if I
can't keep them out--there's no way in hell others who are less skilled at
technology than me will be able to do so. They are so good at hacking it's
unbelievable tbh. That's also what makes it tough it's like I can't even
communicate with anyone anymore or else I risk spreading these guys'
malware to other people which they will then ultimately try and use the
people around me/their accounts against me. (By doing the same thing as
they do to me, deleting their videos to try and make me look crazy,
monitoring them and whether or not they are home at any given time just
like with me, etc, trying to corrupt them against me, etc, etc--the only
difference is the ultimate target is me--at this time at least--like they
would actually stop after me tho lol--yea right--they seem to have done
this a time or two before if you ask me)

I'm working on getting out of here btw. I just got a few things I need to
take care of first. It's almost as if I have to ditch all technology
entirely, and with that my career, and stop talking to everyone i know
pretty much in order to even have a chance at truly getting away from them.
Because all the hacking really is the key. That's what allows them to do
this kind of stuff and get away with it. All they do is exploit
vulnerabilities--both physically and digitally. I wish I could have just
had a normal brother. From here on out I'll just keep updating this google
drive folder so as to avoid texting ppl all the time cuz I know all it does
psychologically is make me be associated with bad stuff in peoples
minds--when in reality I'm just telling others all the bad stuff these guys
are doing to me. (Cuz I don't want them to be able to continue doing all
this stuff to others and get away with it) And because I don't want to
spread any of their malware. So from now on if you want to know what's
going on with me, just look here: https://bit.ly/cwg-police-videos

Happy thanksgiving all, wish me luck in all this. Thank you again for being
good neighbors. Now it's time for me to be a good neighbor and leave.
(Although from no fault of my own, I hope you'll at least recognize that in
looking back on all this, if nothing else)

Keep an eye out for any vehicles/neighbors with vehicles who have new car
license plates more often than one might typically expect. That seems to be
a strategy of this group of people is to drive new cars with new car
license plates I‚Äôve noticed. If I had to paint a profile from everything
I've seen, there are at least two different categories of people in this
criminal organization. There's like the grunt workers, who typically have
cars that aren't as nice and there really isn't any pattern I have seen to
be able differentiate the grunt peoples cars other than they might park in
strange locations, they might come and park somewhere then leave or get
picked up, etc. And a lot of them seem to be Mexican or have troubled
pasts‚Äîbut not all of them.

Then there are like the higher up people, some of which I suspect are
actually our neighbors. And among the higher up people I've noticed a lot
of them have tinted windows and/or new car license plates. Like this
neighbor to the south west of me I've seen his white ford truck a lot
during suspicious times lately and I think he may have even been wearing
shorts similar to the shorts seen in the break in videos when he jumped out
to talk to me today. In reality I kinda blocked him when I returned home
because I was trying to get his license plates, you know just because I‚Äôve
seen that truck before during suspicious times as I‚Äôve said, but it makes
it hard when their license plates are all handwritten and/or behind tinted
glass, etc. (it could be a deliberate strategy is all I'm saying, to have
plates that are hard to read like that) He even asked me how I knew that
about the license plates, I told him just from observation. But yea, he
said he lives just down the street and it wasn‚Äôt him, so take that for what
it‚Äôs worth. Anyways, those are two of the profiles or patterns I have
identified thus far with these guys. I can't wait until it snows tbh--I
hope it snows like crazy this year.

What they are doing to me I suspect is called ‚Äúgangstalking‚Äù btw. (
https://books.google.com/books?id=6SIhEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT3&lpg=PT3&dq=mobbing+emf&source=bl&ots=HUR8BAelOW&sig=ACfU3U0FI7TrhCJjuTJ8g2vBnXtkqchLkg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9lbHN3MrzAhWonGoFHbwbBc8Q6AF6BAgUEAM#v=onepage&q=mobbing%20emf&f=false
)
The purpose of ‚Äúgangstalking‚Äù is to discredit an individual and to be able
to kill an individual who already knows the truth essentially‚Äîand still get
away with it. It can only be pulled off by those skilled in hacking and
those skilled in psychology and/or those with enough money and resources to
be able to devote to it. But it is the best way to go if you are faced with
someone who knows the truth and that truth is inconvenient to you. (I.e.
the truth which that person knows could very well lead to you possibly
facing some serious prison time‚Äîif gone unchecked) If you lookup
gangstalking, you‚Äôll find there is mixed signals on it online. Like some
resources say it‚Äôs legit and lay out essentially what it is and why it‚Äôs
used. Other resources say that it is completely insane. But the thing is,
if you look at it logically. Who are the perpetrators of any would be
gangstalking, by it‚Äôs own definition? They would have to be people with a
lot of money whom are skilled in both computers/hacking, (which is the best
way to get advanced insight into the target individuals these days‚Äîadvanced
insight is by definition required for gangstalking) and they would also
have to be skilled in psychology whereas the whole point of gangstalking is
to discredit the individuals and make them appear crazy in the public
domain. Therefore it makes sense why there are some comments out there
saying individuals who think they are being gangstalked are really just
nuts. Cuz for one those comments were likely left by people who actually
benefit from gangstalking, people who are by definition skilled with
hacking and by definition‚Äîknow the power of psychology and public
perception, and for two, if you really believe in gangstalking like I now
do‚Äîdo you really think people like me would want to risk potentially
pissing off other gangstalking operations by combating all their negative
commentary on gangstalking publicly? I don‚Äôt think so. At least for me;
it‚Äôs in my best interest to only have one gangstalking crew after me at one
time lol. So it actually makes sense why there are differing opinions on
the subject out there in my view. (Another good book on gangstalking and
how friends and family members should treat me to increase the odds of
successful litigation later:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BX97GW6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?\_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1
)

There is documented evidence that gangstalking is indeed real and it is
indeed highly effective; just look up the church of Scientology and how
they successfully used ‚Äúgangstalking‚Äù against IRS agents to get the United
States government to back down from further prosecuting them essentially.
The bug sweep guy told me that.

Today is my brother‚Äôs birthday. I‚Äôve been working on making some
improvements as discussed with Tom from Tom Ham investigations. I got new
mereco locks and I‚Äôve been putting all my cameras in the eves.

Check it out, I did this scan of the surrounding wireless networks last
night and look at all these wireless networks--these did not show up when
Tom was here.

Also check out all the open ports I have on all my devices--it‚Äôs insane.
The iphone of which, I just reset it literally yesterday. All of those open
ports aren‚Äôt normal btw. And there is no real way for me to close them
because as you can see they obviously control my router through all the
open ports on it.

New counter measures:

I find it odd that my brother will go extra hard on me on days like my
birthday then he gives me a break on his birthday only to ramp up the
pressure again later. By ramping up the pressure I mean he‚Äôll hit me with
ever more intense directed energy beams. 228+ EF for instance.

I‚Äôve been having new abnormal feelings in my lungs recently which is
concerning‚Äîespecially when considering all that I stated previously about
how I suspect the attackers put something in my vape juice previously. I
hope my body is able to overcome whatever it may be.

I added this new photo of one of my latest readings from my emf
reader‚Äîwhich demonstrates my emf complaints are in fact legitimate and my
complaints are definitely from something that is external in nature, at the
very least.. (999 EF reading at its peak ‚Äîthey completely maxed it out
overnight) This reading wouldn‚Äôt have been possible otherwise. I left it on
over night and this is the result. They completely maxed out my emf reader.
It‚Äôs not normal for the electrical fields to shift by that much in one
location‚Äîlet alone to be that high next to where I sleep like ever.

Things have seemed to calm down a little bit however, which I‚Äôm extremely
grateful for.

One more thing, I was scrolling through the apps relating to Lexus the
other day, and I noticed there‚Äôs an app built for Lexus‚Äôs which allows you
to completely control your car and determine its location, kinda like
onstar or whatever‚Äîit uses a 3g network. So I signed up for it just to
check it out. However my car didn‚Äôt behave as expected when I signed up,
it‚Äôs not registering with the app correctly. After calling customer
support, they said I have to take it into the dealer because it appears as
though my Lexus is malfunctioning. But the thing is anyone who had access
to my car's vin number could have signed up for that service without my
knowledge essentially‚Äîespecially if they had direct access to my car to hit
the hazard lights just briefly, which normally is supposed to be what
engages the whole thing. (After making the monthly payment for the add on
service) So now I have to take it to the dealer to get that looked into and
my electronic key signature changed. I do suspect the attackers may have
registered my Lexus already via this same app using a different email
address as a way to track me‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs a lot cleaner and less detectable
way of gps tracking. But I guess we‚Äôll see once I get to the dealer.
(Either that or they use the satellite radio somehow to track me‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen
them change my cars settings remotely before when I wasn‚Äôt even touching
anything)

Do you want to know what infrasound feels like? Let me show you what
infrasound can do to your body‚Äîif directed at you by professionals using
professional equipment. I have never gotten that Kardia mobile to report
any irregularities with my heart before I tried it last night when they
were infrasounding me. I know they were infrasounding me cuz you can hear
the freaking sound, it sounds like someone is blasting their bass/subwoofer
far away but in the middle of the night/morning‚Äîhowever the sound is
directed only at you come to find out.

The sound/infrasound was coming primarily from the west/south-west last
night btw.

What does infrasound do to you? It makes your heart beat faster and/or out
of rhythm.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W71QopoIZqu0hmVsEmPM0VrH4PtCuQ\_f/view?usp=drivesdk


As you can see in the above link, my heart was all out of whack last night
when they were infrasounding me until I went out to my car and took a
reading‚Äîsuggesting they have capabilities to infrasound me primarily while
in my house. I literally took the readings 3 minutes apart. And I wanted to
make sure my heart wasn‚Äôt just messed up which is why I went out to my car
to take the last reading‚Äîsure enough‚Äîthat last one in my car was perfectly
normal.

I‚Äôve now proven both emf and infrasound to a certain degree‚Äîboth coming
from an external source. I‚Äôve also proven there are/have been multiple
people breaking into my house/messing with my house‚Äîat the very least.

These guys I‚Äôm dealing with are professionals at what they do. Of course
they are going to choose things that exacerbate other issues of the
targeted individual and/or else things that appear as though they could be
caused by other sources‚Äîwhen looking at it all shallowly and without
context‚Äîthat‚Äôs the smartest way to do it. If I were a criminal I‚Äôd do the
same thing cuz it‚Äôs the smartest way to do it if you don‚Äôt want to get
caught.

They always go hardest on me when I have something important the next day
too, like a doctors appointment or work, etc, but at the end of the day
they couldn‚Äôt do any of this without all the hacking‚Äîso hacking definitely
plays a role as well. I‚Äôve proven all the hacking over and over as well,
too bad hacking is so hard to trace back to the perpetrators or I‚Äôd be set.

Previous recordings of my heart when they weren‚Äôt infrasounding me‚Äîall else
constant. (I‚Äôll keep doing these and notating what‚Äôs going on at the time
as well)

Conversation with Dusty‚Äôs old friends from like two weeks or more ago now.
One friend never responded in that thread, but I‚Äôll just say some of my
brother's friends do believe me. And some actually found it odd how dusty
behaved in the past in thinking back on it, after I brought all this to
their attention.

https://codepen.io/chase-gibbons/pen/VwMjmqd (I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to
properly export this conversation so just know this code pen could easily
be tampered with)

I urge you not to overweigh any one of these items. Please give everything
you see here adequate consideration‚Äîand don‚Äôt make any shallow
determinations based on only one or two of the items. Because the fact of
the matter is nothing I‚Äôm doing can explain all this‚Äîand therefore there‚Äôs
really nothing I can ultimately do to make this all better. I‚Äôm only human,
I make mistakes sometimes myself--but I try to correct them when I do.

The only thing that truly can explain all this in full is my brother is
indeed both hacking me and sending people after me‚Äîand he tries his best to
make it look like it‚Äôs all just me or something I‚Äôm doing, he fine-tunes
his attacks to mirror me, and he tries his best to try and discredit me.
That‚Äôs literally the only explanation that explains everything‚Äîwithout
dismissing at least half of all of this as random or insignificant in
nature.

To be clear, I am at a disadvantage in all of this. Because this is all
designed to make me look bad, to be difficult to prove, and to therefore to
give the advantage to the perpetrators. It‚Äôs all designed to seem
outlandish and to go on over time for a reason. When people think about all
this, it‚Äôs common to not consider the full context. It‚Äôs also common to
become desensitized to all of this over time. And it‚Äôs common to consider
any mistake I may make as negating everything, or else to have a conflict
of interest with the truth. So I am clearly at a disadvantage in all this.
Any one-off thing that happens to me in all of this I am forced to
continually try and convince others of its significance within the broader
scheme of things, and that simply is just not how people typically think
over time. And I‚Äôve got to do it without them reaching the wrong conclusion
and without bringing others down unintentionally and without them
over-weighing any one particular item that they may be most familiar with,
etc. People tend to relate things back to that which they have seen before
or that which they know already, myself included. The problem is criminal
masterminds can use that fact and they can use psychology in general to
their advantage.

My brother started getting into psychology in 2019 and I have since seen
all he‚Äôs learned first hand. I plan to re-prioritize the timeline
summarizing everything that‚Äôs occurred since day one in my family for this
reason. (I‚Äôve been meaning to work on a timeline for a while now tbh, to
point out patterns and the overall scheme of things and whatnot in a
condensed but fully cited fashion) But yea, I think it will give everyone a
little better context if nothing else. Plus all the items on it will be
definitive in nature and will have withstood the test of time. I just need
to resuscitate all my old conversation histories first, or what‚Äôs remaining
of them at least. (And on a hacked computer mind you)

Worst case in all of this for me, is my brother is able to succeed in doing
irreversible damage to me, damage which can‚Äôt be tied back to him, damage
which could then be used to explain away everything else I have alleged
against him, and he gets off scott free‚Äîfree to continue his rampage
against other innocent people like me.

Best case is my brother is ultimately held responsible for all that I
suspect he has done to his family. I try to stay open minded but it really
isn‚Äôt even a question for me anymore at this point--I live it daily. And at
the end of the day, my brother being behind all the bad stuff that‚Äôs been
happening to me simply is the only conclusion that explains everything; (as
stated above) sure I get some allegations wrong but the overall scheme of
things is right on; plus these guys continually mock me afterwards and give
me signals that it is indeed my brother orchestrating everything, and it
honestly just makes the most sense. It can and has been used as a pattern
to predict future behavior as well--which is key.

My brother really is like the perfect criminal mastermind. Everything he‚Äôs
ever been interested in really is incorporated into what I suspect he‚Äôs now
doing. Engineering, audio/sound engineering, computers/security,
nanotechnology, electrical engineering, 3d land surveying, psychology, real
estate, physics/chemistry, cryptocurrencies, law, Dre Dre and all his
thug/gang rap music, etc, etc.

The question becomes whether or not I can get others to see it‚Äîand whether
or not I can get others to help me do something about it. My brother and
his new people are completely ruthless tbh. I even become desensitized to
everything over time myself. Hopefully overtime people can come to their
own conclusions with all this.


Timeline coming soon, which will hopefully put everything in a little
better perspective..




Indicators of being hacked

The following outlines some indicators of being hacked based on what I‚Äôve
learned myself. If you have multiple of these indicators--then you could
very well be hacked.

Most the bigger company websites you visit may make you do captchas before
they allow you to proceed to their website out of nowhere like even
google.com. It‚Äôs because the hackers actually rig your browser to send
multiple requests per request that is made, or they rig it to create
multiple sessions. That way the hackers can use any account you are logged
into as you. Therefore one way to tell you are hacked is Google and other
websites will let you know you are hacked essentially, they‚Äôll say it
without saying it. This indicator works across mobile and desktop devices I
have found.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B9GXyp2bXY\_85LdPhwuy1Bver9Yr255W/view?usp=drivesdk

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jj3jJMOPSpfNHU57zSXVAOU8PjRju9vY/view?usp=drivesdk

You may start getting invalid certificate errors on legitimate websites
that would never have an invalid cert by themselves. Like
https://drive.google.com for example. The following means there is
something going on with my network where I‚Äôm being exposed to a man in the
middle attack.


This is not the right certificate for google‚ÄìI‚Äôll just say that right now.
Your browser will make it pretty obvious.


You may start receiving strange text messages like the following which look
more like they are spam and not meant for you more than anything. (In
reality, they are secret commands meant to control your phone based on my
research and experience‚Äìit could mean your sim card is hacked) My
understanding is that if they have control of your router then they can
also send these binary sms messages to your phones to take over your sim.
These are definite indicators of being hacked. Works on mobile phones only.



Another indicator is your mouse will move without you moving it‚Äîwithout any
other legitimate explanation for your mouse to be moving at the time‚Äìand at
odd times. (The hackers like send you signals based on what you are doing,
I also just think the mouse moving is just a side effect of their
hacking/remote viewing/remote accessing) If this happens to you repeatedly
over time, especially if there‚Äôs no other possible explanation‚Äìthen you
could very well be hacked. Works on desktop only.

Another indicator is your screen color might change hues just slightly,
whenever the hackers start watching your screen remotely, from a whiter hue
to a bluer hue. It‚Äôs a side effect of the hackers watching your screen is
what I have come to find out. The hackers can actually change this side
effect to a different one that is not hue related‚Äîbut there will always be
a small side effect of some sort if you are observant enough tmk. The color
hue side effect of being watched happens both on mobile and desktop
devices.

Another indicator is a ton of open ports when you do a network scan. The
open ports are necessary for the hackers to access your devices remotely
essentially. Works for desktop and mobile and your router and everything
else connected to your network. I‚Äôve been using an app called Zenmap as of
lately myself.

Another indicator is your modem may regularly cut out and start downloading
new configurations‚Äîlike it might even stop your Comcast cable tv from
working for a second even‚Äîjust depending on which modem you have and what
the hackers are doing. I know it‚Äôs my brother who hacked me at least in
part because all my issues with my modems started when I was on the phone
with him back in 2019, he essentially social engineered me to put in my
password when I shouldn‚Äôt have when I was trying to help him with his
stupid website. Right after I put in my password‚Äîmy whole network went down
for the first time in that way. Which I later came to find out it was
likely because he gained access to my computer when I put in my password
which then sent a command to my modem to download a new malicious
configuration to my modem which would proceed to hack the rest of my
network, cuz my modem has gone down so many times since and that‚Äôs what
I‚Äôve narrowed it down to. I recall my brother was like holding back from
laughing at the time too. I didn‚Äôt officially realize I had been hacked
until a little while later though, but I did specifically remember my
brother coerced me to put in my password when giving me some of his website
files and right after I did put in my password it took my whole network
down for the first time‚Äîmy network going down like that out of nowhere
seemingly on my input was odd for my network at the time. I‚Äôve been dealing
with it ever since though pretty much, I‚Äôve come to find out what he
installed on my network was actually a hacking AI that infects all of my
devices. So getting rid of it entirely is extremely difficult. Since then I
suspect the hackers have even advanced to rooting my devices I think,
meaning you can‚Äôt even get the malware off any one device by reinstalling
the operating system‚Äîlet alone get all the malware off of the network as a
whole. It‚Äôs a nightmare tbh. My brother has taken a lot of the fun out of
technology for me.

Strange router logs can also indicate your router may be hacked. [Visual
here]

The thing that initially tipped me off to being hacked myself personally
was some of my emails were being deleted, (emails from my brother) and my
phone kept getting really hot at odd times, (like when they poisoned my dog
right in front of me at the park) well that and some of my accounts
passwords/security questions had been altered. So that‚Äôs another way to
tell you are hacked either via stuff being deleted that you know you didn‚Äôt
delete, (both in your accounts and on your computer itself)
passwords/security questions being invalid out of nowhere that you know you
didn‚Äôt change‚Äìespecially pay attention to you router admin password, and
your phone getting hot at odd times. (which could indicate someone is
actively tracking your location)

A lot of times virus detectors won‚Äôt even detect the malware my brother is
using btw--believe me, I have tried a lot of them. I recall my brother used
to try a lot of them himself.

Other things that have happened to me is they‚Äôll interfere with what I
type, especially on mobile. They make it so it‚Äôs damn near impossible to
type sometimes, by like typing over what I‚Äôm trying to type when they are
trying to piss me off at key times.

They will cut my internet connection on both desktop and mobile or else
throttle it at key times‚Äìjust depending on what I'm doing at the time. (I
realize this happens naturally as well and is a common occurrence but the
difference is they‚Äôll do it like to prevent me from being able to work when
next to other coworkers who‚Äôs computers are behaving just fine, they do it
in odd ways and always at key times, they also have cut my internet access
both on my phone and on my computer in order to prevent me from checking on
my cameras previously, prevent me from uploading stuff to this folder, etc,
etc)

They‚Äôll change up my spotify music queue to play songs of their choosing to
try and send me signals.

They will essentially re-program parts of mobile applications so that they
can do things like display a false feed on my arlo video cameras, when I‚Äôm
monitoring whether or not they are breaking into my house in real time
while I‚Äôm away, so as to prevent any chance of me seeing them
whatsoever‚Äìeven if I check on it in real-time. (I caught them doing this
previously by having two arlo cameras pretty much side by side out front,
and having the cars driving by my house not come through synchronously‚Äìlike
the cars weren‚Äôt even present in the one feed closest to my front door‚Äìit
clearly wasn‚Äôt just a buffering issue‚Äìso I initiated my arlo alarm when I
saw that‚Äìthen they changed my arlo app up so I couldn‚Äôt even initiate my
arlo alarm anymore right after‚Äìthat all happened when I was trying to
ensure they didn‚Äôt tamper my house again prior to the bug sweep) I always
reinstall my ring app before leaving my home when I plan to monitor my
house closely these days as well, cuz they‚Äôll essentially reprogram that
particular app to fail to load altogether‚Äìand re-installing the entire app
is the only way I‚Äôve found to get anything on my ring account to load
again.

They reprogram my phone number to forward to other phone numbers or to not
work altogether. They‚Äôll make my phone not block contacts that are clearly
marked as being blocked. (Like my brother for instance, he can still text
me even when he‚Äôs blocked)

What else? I‚Äôll think of more and add it here.

They can act as the middle man between texts and add malicious payloads
and/or change the timing of when texts are sent, change up the wording, or
else prevent them from going out entirely.

They can act as the middle man between emails and prevent me from being
able to send/receive emails, add malicious payloads, change the timing,
etc, etc.

They can listen to you through your microphones at any time‚Äìwithout any
indication they are even listening.

They can tap into your cameras at any time‚Äìwithout any indication they are
even watching. (I recommend getting camera covers)



The best thing you can do if you do suspect you are hacked by my brother,
that I have found at least, is to report it to the Utah Department of
Public Safety - Cyber Division.

https://siac.utah.gov/cyber-security/

I recommend turning your computers off at nighttimes, so they can‚Äôt access
all your stuff while you are asleep.

I recommend you take regular backups of your devices. That way you won‚Äôt
ever lose anything that is important to you and theoretically you could
revert to a non hacked state if you get hacked. (Depending on how deep into
the file system your backups cover)

I wish I had better advice for everyone in regards to how to get unhacked
once you are hacked, but I‚Äôm honestly still figuring that part out myself‚Ä¶
(I guess it also just depends on how hacked you are, identifying the scope
of the hack is key) The best bet might be to document it and report it to
the manufacturers‚Äìor else find a way to get the manufacturers to dig into
it themselves.
Timeline (Rough Draft)

Todo: add references. This is still a work in progress just know that, some
items may be out of order initially until I go back and find exact
references.

My father once told me that he had a good feeling about me. Like in
relation to his other kids. Like I‚Äôd do well or something. I‚Äôve since taken

us that time because he was in trouble essentially.

My father develops an ‚Äúinfection‚Äù by supposedly bumping into a bedframe at
night supposedly in Alaska. (According to my father) It was in one of his
feet, he ultimately had to get one of his big toes cut off.

I recall we went to Alaska fishing twice. Dusty came one of the times. I
think Dusty came the second time. I just remember going to ketchikan
fishing twice. My father got some infection in his foot that bothered him
for the rest of his life. (In a lot of ways, my dad‚Äôs final days remind me
of myself right now‚Äìlike being completely torn down and whatnot, my dad
having to get his toe chopped off, my dad having his wife threaten to
divorce him, etc‚Äìonly with me it‚Äôs a little different but it‚Äôs very much
along the same lines of being humiliated and torn down prior)
~2009Dusty and Cindy

Dusty, my brother, (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16htiaOfvTWqNEHQNWD\_h4aIrhLKcB1dm/view?usp=sharing
) and Cindy, (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HqEtatP91f-1UF0n6mgzEou4ShGlkJj4/view?usp=sharing
) my stepmom, were always close. They always had an inexplicable
relationship in my mind. They would always stay up drinking alcohol at
nighttimes together along with Cindy‚Äôs son Shawn. I‚Äôve never been big into
alcohol myself, I‚Äôd occasionally drink during parties or whatever, plus I
was always hanging out with my girlfriend, Annie, all the time around this
time myself, whenever I wasn‚Äôt working at the assembly line at icon.

2010
Divorce/Move Out

I hear from my father that Cindy, his wife at the time, may be divorcing
him and that Dusty and I needed to find another place to live.

Father‚Äôs Death

A little while after my father had to get his toe cut off, and shortly
after my dad told us we had to move out, my brother Dusty (Aka Dustin, aka
Baze) supposedly finds our dad unresponsive laying face first on the ground
in the hallway after going to and returning from the gas station closeby.
He finds our father laying in the middle of the hallway next to the piano
where he supposedly proceeded to call the paramedics and do CPR on him. My
father was on his way out the door to pick up my little sister, (half
sister) Taylor, (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QwC3FA8S1wsD7\_XoQW77Izx3nw0WBYh7/view?usp=sharing
) from the mall at the time when my dad apparently went down face first in
the middle of the hallway. (Smashed his nose in he hit the ground so hard
apparently) My brother apparently called some of his friends right after. I
don‚Äôt know if my brother was on the best terms with my father at the time.
I know my brother held resentment towards my father for ‚Äúmaking‚Äù him follow
in his footsteps as a civil engineer. My brother was set to graduate with
his bachelor‚Äôs in civil engineering a week later. My father had called me I
think it was the day before, we were supposed to go in and get a new loan
on my car or something from cache valley bank later on that day or the next
day.


While in my bedroom downstairs with my girlfriend at the time, Annie, my
brother comes downstairs to get us and to inform us of what is going on
upstairs. If you want to know what we were up to just ask, I‚Äôm going to try
to keep this as straightforward as possible for brevity reasons. When we
got halfway up the stairs after Dusty came and got us, we see there are
paramedics working on my father who is laying in the middle of the hallway
next to the piano--seemingly unresponsive to the paramedics.

Annie and I follow the paramedics to the hospital. At the hospital we are
joined by Cindy who was apparently in Ogden at her biker bar at the time.
(But she beat us to Logan Regional somehow) When the notion of an autopsy
is brought up, Cindy says she doesn‚Äôt think we need one. I object and say
something like well then we‚Äôll never know why he died. She responds by
saying essentially that if my dad had overdosed as she suspected and we did
an autopsy then we would lose out on a million dollar life insurance policy
if the autopsy showed an overdose. The doctor concurs with Cindy saying he
likely died of a heart attack. (But the thing is, everyone technically dies
by having a heart attack, the question is what the heck caused the heart
attack to begin with‚ÄîI really don‚Äôt think my dad overdosed just for the
record‚Äîhow could he just go lights out like that mid-walk without putting
his hand out to catch him or anything? Plus my dad wasn‚Äôt on drugs and I
don't think he would have overdosed on his prescriptions‚Äîhe was a
responsible adult after all) But yea, we still don‚Äôt know why my dad
died--it was very sudden and unexpected in nature. Dusty never went to the
hospital afterwards even though my dad hadn‚Äôt even been pronounced dead yet
when he was taken by the paramedics from our house.

Right After Father‚Äôs Death

Dusty had time off after my father‚Äôs death.

Dusty graduates with his bachelor‚Äôs degree as a civil engineer and he
bounces to Ogden--even though he wouldn‚Äôt have a job for a little over a
year.

My father‚Äôs trust is distributed according to his wishes. He was worth
approximately $7 million dollars when he passed. (‚Öì went to Cindy, the
remaining ‚Öî got split equally between my father‚Äôs 4 children)

Dusty repeatedly brings up the notion that our father was just about to
change up his trust before his passing. (What that means, idk)

Karie, our half sister, becomes the trustee of the children‚Äôs trust. (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v2Jetq8r9TDkU8EUR89IxZu69Qlj9NFW/view?usp=sharing
) Cindy becomes the trustee of the marital trust.

Cindy and Karie never liked each other all that much.




~2011
Trust/College

My brother and Cindy quickly become displeased with Karie--and remain
bitter throughout; they didn‚Äôt like the job she was doing as trustee--to
say the least. Cindy was frustrated about Karie in relation to my little
sister Taylor‚Äôs trust, Dusty was frustrated about Karie in relation to his
trust) To be clear, I had my frustrations with Karie and my trust, mostly
just in their lack of transparency and their being a little shady trying to
get us to sign something saying none of us could be trustee if she couldn‚Äôt
serve previously, (which I now kinda understand why) I had questioned their
selling of all our dad‚Äôs assets previously, including their giving away our
dad‚Äôs companies for next to nothing, but beyond that I actually always had
a pretty decent relationship with Karie.

I go back to college determined to take it more seriously this time. Karie
does a good job at holding me accountable and ensuring I do well.

2013
Graduation

I graduate from college with my bachelor‚Äôs degree in MIS. (Management
Information Systems) I essentially attribute a lot of my success to the
fact that Karie let me go back to college and held me responsible for my
grades this time. (Which my father never did, my father helped pay for my
college beforehand but he never really held me to account for my grades
previously, etc)

Eyes of a Killer2015
Before Sister‚Äôs Death

Karie and the trust lawyer and Paul, the successor trustee accountant, had
actually tried getting us all to sign something saying in the event Karie
is incapacitated then none of us could become the successor trustee--before
they ever disclosed to us Karie was indeed quickly becoming
incapacitated--which wasn‚Äôt very transparent at the time. (But I now
understand why, I think Karie might have had some suspicions herself) When
asked whether something was wrong with Karie at the time she denied.

I received word from one of my friends at the time, Nick Poppleton, that my
sister supposedly had cancer. At first i didn‚Äôt know which sister he was
even referring to. And I‚Äôll be honest, this friend wasn‚Äôt known to be the
most credible person at the time. But once I found out he was referring to
Karie and that his wife‚Äôs father actually worked with Raedell, who was
Karie‚Äôs mother, I honestly believed him more but I still didn‚Äôt know what
to think cuz I hadn‚Äôt heard anything from Karie or my trust myself. I
brought it up to like Dusty and Taylor at the time but again, I didn‚Äôt know
if it was true or not.

I suspect around 2015 is also when my brother first started using some kind
of something against me meant to discredit me--but I wouldn‚Äôt find out that
was attributable to Dusty until much later..

I went from first kinda believing my friend to ultimately not believing him
anymore about Karie, (because Karie had done a good job at keeping it all a
secret and that particular friend was known for making stuff up) back
to--holy shit my friend was telling the truth the whole time--when our
trust finally told us Karie did in fact have cancer--non hodgkins lymphoma
to be precise. (Which was odd given how Karie was the healthiest person I
had ever met in my life--she was a personal trainer/physical therapist who
ate all organics, etc--and I don‚Äôt think there was any family history of
non hodgkin's lymphoma in either side of her family)

Sister‚Äôs Death

Not long later, that same friend who initially informed me of Karie not
doing well called me and told me that Karie was on her deathbed at Logan
Regional Hospital and that we had better get down there essentially. So I
called Taylor, my little sister, and Dusty, my brother, and informed them
of what my friend had told me. I went and picked Taylor up from her house
and Dusty agreed to drive up from Ogden.

When Taylor and I first got there we didn‚Äôt even recognize Karie--I know I
didn‚Äôt. Keep in mind we hadn‚Äôt seen Karie since she had looked so beautiful
prior. We go into the hospital room that my friend had told me to goto, and
my first reaction was I didn‚Äôt even recognize the person laying in the
hospital bed--she looked like a hundred year old bald lady who was pregnant
from all the tumors growing out of her--but I did recognize Raedell,
Karie‚Äôs mother. At that point any beef I had for Karie in her actions as
our trustee completely fell by the wayside, like at the end of the day
Karie was my sister and I loved her, plus she helped me get through
college. I ended up thanking her for her actions as our trustee in what I
think was the last time Karie even attempted to talk back to anyone. Taylor
just acted a little frustrated that Karie had hidden this all from us for
so long. Taylor obviously cared about Karie, she just felt hurt she wasn‚Äôt
invited to be there for her more before that point. Taylor and I stayed
there in Karie‚Äôs room until they asked us to go out so that they could do
something medically to Karie, at which point I got word from Dusty that he
was arriving. So Taylor and I went out to the parking lot to greet Dusty.

We greeted Dusty and showed him to the room where Karie was at. I paid
close attention to both Dusty and Taylor‚Äôs reaction to Karie. Dusty I
noticed didn‚Äôt even say a word to Karie. Raedell announced to Karie that
Dusty was now there, but both Raedell and Taylor didn‚Äôt pay any attention
to Dusty or how he subsequently treated Karie.

Dusty proceeded to go up to the top of Karie‚Äôs would be deathbed, he stood
I think between Raedell and Karie with his back facing Raedell. He then
grabbed Karie by the top of her bald head--seemingly kinda hard too--and
then he started moving her head from side to side with his hand--meanwhile
he was grinning the whole time. He treated Karie like she were a barbie
doll or something and he treated her like he was somehow happy she were in
her current state. Like he treated her as if he had no sympathy for her
whatsoever--he treated her like he was trying to send her a signal. Dusty
never said anything to Karie. Dusty never even said anything about how
Karie looked either. (Like how she was completely unrecognizable to me and
Taylor) Right after that Dusty insisted we all leave so that Taylor could
‚Äústudy for her exam‚Äù the next day, Dusty was only there for a total of like
5 minutes. Taylor and I concurred only because we planned to come back the
next day but ended up not being able to because Karie was pronounced dead
later on that evening. Later on that same evening I called my mom crying
just overwhelmed with everything. I told my mom what I had saw Dusty do to
Karie. My mom apparently told Dusty that I had seen him do that to Karie
right after, and he apologized to me over sms later. I wish I hadn‚Äôt told
my mom I saw him do that tbh, I wouldn‚Äôt have ever even said anything to
him about it had it been up to me‚Äìit was that serious‚Äìlike I‚Äôd prefer him
to not know I saw him do that to her.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zHkFVCRavIiPMJe45LAn0XuhaVr0WlHC&disco=AAAATjPaCi4


All I‚Äôm saying is why did Dusty even show up that evening if that‚Äôs all he
was going to do to her?

Dusty had time off before/after Karie‚Äôs death.

Dusty demonized Karie both before and after her death.




~2016
After Sister‚Äôs Death

Dusty treating Karie that way was odd to say the least but at the end of
the day he was my brother and I loved him/looked up to him. So I gave him
the benefit of doubt.

In hanging out at Dusty‚Äôs house around this time I recall my brother
showing some friends and I the dark web for the first and only time. He
told us how you can even buy drugs and hitmen on it, all the while he was
talking about how secure it was. I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd actually do it at the
time though. He essentially showed me how to access the dark web using the
tor browser at the time, but that‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt recall the name of the site
he was on. I never even dug into the dark web myself until much later, when
doing research on what all was possible after I started being attacked
myself. (Now I think he may have deliberately showed us that potentially so
he could try and frame me later--but in this case it backfired because this
is how I know dusty has access to hitmen)

Dusty got a new phone after both deaths in my family. Dusty encouraged me
to get a new apple phone around this time..

Dusty has always been better at computers than me--even though he hides it,
he was into them long before I ever was. I didn‚Äôt even get into computers
and programming until I was a junior in college and forced to choose
something essentially, because my career placement exam said I was
extremely analytical, and because the career advisor recommended MIS as a
good paying opportunity given my results. The people who can develop the
skills necessary to do all this low level programming, and then to hide the
fact that they are good at it, those are who you need to keep an eye on.
(It‚Äôs as if they don‚Äôt want anyone knowing they are good at hacking, and
the best hackers are likely those who have been into computers their whole
lives)

I recall after Karie‚Äôs death in talking to my brother, Dusty said something
like people tend to die from that which they fear the most or something.
(Referring to karie and her being healthy as shit yet dying from cancer at
the young age of 39) I also recall confronting him about him never saying
anything about the way Karie looked at the hospital, and how I found it
odd. (Because at this point there had always been a small question in my
mind about my father, like what if someone had done something to his
prescriptions or something--they could have totally gotten away with it
whereas no autopsy was done thanks to Cindy--and I also had questions about
Karie--but Karie used to always travel so I had a sense that if anyone had
done something to Karie than it would have to be someone who had hacked her
and therefore someone who wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised by the site of
Karie--because they had been monitoring her the whole time essentially)
Dusty didn‚Äôt have a good response to my questioning--but I still had no
reason to suspect him really--if I suspected anyone it was still Cindy, cuz
Cindy and Karie never got along to say the least and because Cindy was
considering divorcing my dad right before he passed, (If she had, she would
have gotten none of his wealth) Cindy hung out with biker dudes at the
time, she owned a biker bar in Ogden, she had a biker dude stay over at the
house something like 2 weeks after my dad‚Äôs death, etc, etc.

2018

Dusty gets fired from his job as a civil engineer. (At the time, he brought
up to me something like he was trying to implement some russian php program
or something at his work and his work didn‚Äôt like it or something, idk‚ÄìI
know that‚Äôs supposedly not what he told my mom though)

Dusty has time off starting now until arguably present day, his recording
studio but that‚Äôs just bs.
2019Brother Distancing/Time Off

I purchase one of my father‚Äôs commercial unit‚Äôs from my little sister
Taylor. (Thereby continuing my father‚Äôs legacy)

Dusty doesn‚Äôt show up for dinner with me, Cindy, and Taylor‚Äìthe dinner
meant to finalize my purchase agreement with Taylor. Cindy starts having
regrets even though she‚Äôs the one who convinced Taylor to sell it for an
annuity in the first place; I recall Dusty didn‚Äôt want me to purchase it or
something either later. But I needed the extra parking and I purchased it
for a reason.

My brother Dusty begins distancing himself from everyone besides Cindy,
from what I gather.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FE6\_CBf8LTCrDjbj-BE-eLhdAbmxGj1C&disco=AAAATigPpBc


My brother texts me saying he‚Äôs been learning psychology, reading books on
psychology, and he tells me how he‚Äôs been talking to a psychologist who
said our mom is a narcissist and he started saying all this messed up stuff
about my mom‚Äôs teeth and how she used to be a druggy and all this messed up
stuff, at least part of which he said he heard from Cindy. He recommends I
read a psychology book myself and stop talking to our mom myself, quit my
job, etc.

My brother begins vigorously disparaging my mom and our whole family both
privately to our whole family and publicly, calling my mom a narcissist,
making up all these lies about our whole family and even posting some of it
on his facebook. (Our mom‚Äôs side of the family now)

When taking my dog for a walk one day I walk up on one of my neighbors to
the East essentially abusing his kid, his wife opens the door cuz the kid
started screaming, she said firmly to the dad at the time‚Äì‚Äùyou had better
not be hurting him again‚Äù. Then the wife sees me. They follow me that day
on my walk.

I see two dudes with I think beanies sitting in a van sitting outside my
house a few months later--both with laptops, as soon as they see me looking
out the window at them they drive off. I later see the occupants of that
van go into the child abuser‚Äôs house.


Last Visit/Website/Brother Hacking

My brother and his felon friend, Tom Finn, come over to my house and act
all hostile to me out of nowhere. Dusty takes back his Christmas present he
gave me the year before, he took my guitar, they ask if they can go in my
garage for some reason while I was busy doing something else, (I recall Tom
had a backpack on) etc, and that‚Äôs the last time I ever even saw my brother
face to face. (He never gave me my guitar back and he‚Äôs been hostile
towards me ever since; I ended up telling him he could just keep the guitar
a little while later seems how I had a sense he was keeping it anyways, I
told him that later on for his birthday or Christmas or something like
that) #garage #framingme

My brother goes into sleeper mode. (Which was a red flag given all that
happened in the past)

Dusty started talking like a gangster‚Äìlike he completely changed the way he
would talk to everyone‚Äìit was weird, (Sometimes I wonder if he has
multiple personalities) but then he deleted everything later. #gang

My brother Dusty asks me to do his website for his new recording studio,
even though he was perfectly capable to do it himself. Whereas he had all
the sudden distanced himself from all his friends and family, I told him I
would do it for him just to try and develop some kind of a relationship
with him again. (Who makes all these enemies and pushes away their family
and friends right when trying to start a new business anyhow?)

He asked me to come work with him around that time but he was clearly being
shady so I denied. Plus my brother has always been difficult to work with,
I‚Äôm sure I could have been better to work with as well but he freakin used
it to hack me.

Dusty flakes out on hanging out anymore.

Dusty encourages me to use social media more. (I felt like he could just be
trying to look for a better way to do something to me without him being the
only suspect given how shady and hostile he had been acting out of
nowhere‚Äìso I didn‚Äôt take his advice)

Dusty recommends a book to me called ‚ÄúNever eat alone‚Äù.

I get hacked by my brother through some of his website files he shared with
me at the time‚Äìthe only time he talked to me on the phone the whole time.
He essentially social engineered me to put in my password over the phone
that day. It took down my modem right after I did.

Someone Tries to Fill My Prescriptions

The pharmacist at Reeds notified me that someone tried filling my
prescriptions--striking a nerve with me whereas there was always a small
seed of doubt in my mind about my father‚Äôs death, all his prescriptions,
and the prospect of someone potentially tampering with his prescriptions to
kill him. I did not have many friends at the time beyond my co-workers, (On
purpose, to stay away from bad influences) so I knew it had to have been my
brother because the pharmacist brought it up to me because he wasn‚Äôt sure
if it was me. (Meaning whomever it was likely at least sounded somewhat
like me, plus my brother was acting shady as hell at the time)

Testing My Brother

I confront my brother about him killing Karie and our father for Cindy,
over email--just as a test. My brother responded to my email saying
something about how much Karie charged us to be our trustee, but the email
is deleted from my inbox right afterwards somehow. I look into how that
could be possible, I find there is such a thing of confidential self
deleting email messages and I attribute that email being deleted to that.
(However, I‚Äôve since found out that confidential self deleting emails are
marked clearly as such‚Äìand I don‚Äôt recall this email from dusty as being
marked that way when I did glance at it before it was deleted)

My brother tells me he thinks my dog should die all rudely over imessage,
when I started opening up to him about some of my frustrations. #plot

My dog and I get poisoned for the first time on our walk the very next
day--a group of Mexicans came up and deliberately put what appeared to be
this strange grayish paste poison substance on my dog‚Äôs forearm--while
pretending to pet him/pick him up. #plot

My phone got hot at the time. #hacking

My brother texted into the group conversation between my siblings and I
right after the mexicans put that shit on turbo, (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TwEBUWSWpaOQLLgTQGL-Wq\_tqkWIKc4W/view?usp=sharing
) disparaging our mother further--even though he said he was blocking us
all the day prior‚Äìas if to send me a signal that it was directed by him.
(As if I didn‚Äôt know that already) #signal #plot

I knew it had to have been poison cuz it made both me and my dog feel
funny, (I wiped it off turbo cuz he wouldn‚Äôt walk any further until I got
it off him) and even then my dog didn‚Äôt want to walk more than 100ft more
that day, which was uncharacteristic for him at the time. It made me feel
like kinda messed up at first, then it made my whole body ache for days
afterwards. I couldn‚Äôt get it off--it kept seeping out of my pours for
days--despite repeated washing. I finally figured out that rubbing
alcohol/apple cider vinegar helped in washing it off but even still it
required repeated washing over time as it seeped out of my skin.

Dusty blames him being the way he is on our mother. (Only caring about

Dusty says he‚Äôll have Paul take ‚Äúhis money‚Äù out of my account. #signal

Dusty says I‚Äôm going to regret not having more people around me. #people

To be clear‚ÄìI don‚Äôt have a lot of people around me these days because no
people are better than bad influences.

I discovered the hacking for the first time definitively. #hacking

Dusty freaked the hell out to my mother when he found out I went down to
his recording studio with my phone in airplane mode one day. (Now I think I
know why, cuz he knows he‚Äôs guilty/he was up to no good at his recording
studio and/or he thought I might try to do something similar to him as a
result of what he did to me or something) These days they can still access
my phone even when I‚Äôm in airplane mode.

Dusty disparages Karie repeatedly. #karie


Dusty doesn't deny being a serial killer nor does he deny being in a gang
when asked by me directly numerous times over email.

I send Dusty an email worried about there potentially being holes in his
brain from all the acid he‚Äôs done over the years‚Äìbased on a video I watched
that said it was possible‚Äìhe takes offense to it. #brain

I notice what I thought were cops were now following me, neighbors seemed
suspicious of something in my garage out of nowhere. #garage #framingme

I hear people outside my house in middle of the night, I smell cigarette
smoke through my bedroom window. (Which I‚Äôve honestly never smelt in my
neighborhood before period) #people

Dusty says he has been learning AI, won‚Äôt elaborate any further. #ai

Dusty begins deleting all his previous messages. (Including deleting shit
off MY DEVICES) #coverup

Dusty tells me ‚Äúhe has his own people now‚Äù, when talking to him about how
he needs our family. #people

I confront my brother saying he‚Äôd be crazy to try and kill me right then
essentially--because if he had still lived in Logan he‚Äôd know people are
suspicious of all the deaths in our family as is and how there was a
pattern of the deaths being 5 years apart. (Notice the timing of the
attack, it was mid way through 2019, or four years after karie‚Äôs death)
This is when I first started looking back on everything and is when I first
started truly suspecting my brother of potentially killing some of our
family--I straight up asked him after all and he completely failed that
test and all tests I have thrown his way since then--miserably. Like can
you even think of a worse response to my test? (Circle of black feathers
left outside my house right after, deleting his response out of my inbox,
telling me my dog should die, phone getting hot when poisoned, someone
trying to fill my prescriptions, disparaging our whole family, etc, etc) I
can‚Äôt. This stuff is scary.

Dusty backs off for the time being..

2020Second Poisoning


Poisoned again this time from a key I left out for a tenant who was
interested in renting one of my little sister‚Äôs commercial units (the unit
was located within the commercial building of our father‚Äôs I had purchased
from my little sister Taylor (Cindy‚Äôs daughter) when Dusty first started
distancing himself from me--it happened after the prospective tenants left
the key in the drop spot outside to give the keys back to me. (Remember, I
was hacked so the hackers would have known where the keys were left) It was
a similar substance as the first time except this time it was clear instead
of grey but it gave me a similar initial feeling, it smelt similar, and I
was able to differentiate this time that it made all my lymph nodes swell
up for days afterwards. (The first time I just knew it made my whole body
ache, this second time I realized it was really all my lymph nodes swelling
up/aching) Sound familiar? Lymph nodes are what are affected in non
hodgkin's lymphoma‚Äìwhich is what Karie died from.

Again I can tie this second poisoning back to Dusty.

Gun Pulled On Me

I notify my brother that my dog turbo is in bad shape, he has multiple
organ failure and is not going to be around much longer, in trying to give
Dusty the benefit of doubt from what happened in the past again. I
specifically pointed out how he used to like turbo and be close to turbo,
secretly hoping I could take turbo to go say goodbye to dusty.

Hispanic male starts stalking my neighborhood literally like 25 minutes
after I sent that message to my brother. Seems turbo‚Äôs prognosis was grim
anyways, I go out to try and take a picture of the guy‚Äôs car. The guy stops
all irritated with me, ends up pulling a gun on me. I call the police only
because he pulled a freaking gun on me. (I was just trying to spook him
away initially--I had nothing on him prior to him pulling his gun on me)
The police track him down and pull him over and arrest him. Jacade Rausch
is his name. I guess he had drugs on him at the time. He‚Äôs now facing up to
~40 years in prison.

My dog Turbo dies literally like 27 hours later. (

Witness Intimidation

I begin to do a ring neighbors social media post to notify the neighbors of
what had happened with the suspected stalking/guy pulling a gun on me.
(Initially I thought he may have just been lost doing a drug delivery or
something until I found out that guy actually was from around here even
though he had license plates from another state) (

Child abuser‚Äôs (
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSBbS1KNBGcXheMrK1JETPhNqP2AFmg\_/view?usp=sharing
) kid starts showing up at my house for the first time out of the whole
time they‚Äôve lived next to me, asking to ‚Äúplay‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know who‚Äôs kid it
was until some time later. #intimidation (

Posted the ring neighbor‚Äôs app post after the kid started being sent to
intimidate me--not before. (Meaning nobody even knew about the guy pulling
a gun on me yet) (https://neighbors.ring.com/event/Vxp7yxNSxV )

Child abuser‚Äôs kid starts coming to my house again and again--every
week--and on key dates. Saying a different thing each time. The first few
times he asked to ‚Äúplay‚Äù. Then he started saying something having to do
with ‚Äúkill‚Äù or ‚Äúdeath‚Äù or something like ‚Äúkill him‚Äù or something like that.
He would show up at my house on key dates too like on my birthday and labor
day for instance. Like it clearly wasn‚Äôt random‚Äìit was meant to intimidate
me/stress me out on otherwise happy days. Clearly directed by someone
intimately familiar with me. #intimidation (

EMF

Emf started--they made it extra intense on my dog‚Äôs would-be sixteenth
birthday. (Night of September 15, 2021) I hadn‚Äôt even thought about my dog
much that day, I had had a good day. I had actually felt earthquake
sensations like five days in a row leading up to me actually realizing I
was being EMF‚Äôd on this day, while sitting on my bed each night coding,
which I was later able to correlate to go hand-in-hand with the EMF stuff.
So they had been EMF-ing me prior, only on September 15 they made it extra
intense specifically because it was my dog's birthday. It completely heated
my head/brain to the point where my head was hot to the touch externally
and it felt hot internally as well. I had to put ice packs on my head the
next morning. My whole head/back felt sunburnt the following days. #emf

I reported it to the police for the first time on September 16, 2021, the
afternoon after I could actually somewhat decipher what it might be whereas
they intensified it and whatnot.

I continued speaking to that detective and other officers about the
subsequent attacks for weeks. Some of the police officers have treated me
seriously throughout, like that Joseph Escobar detective for instance‚ÄìI
like him. I think he may have been from a different agency or something
though, but I‚Äôm honestly not sure. The cops did show me solidarity I think
on more than one occasion, however they obviously don‚Äôt tell me whether any
of my tips led to them discovering anything or not directly. #emf

Eagles Incident - Murder by Suicide Plot

I suspect my brother Dusty purposely misconstrued a message I sent to him
and he reported me as being suicidal to the police. (After I reported him
for the EMF stuff) That particular police officer Dusty called made me call
Dusty directly seems how Dusty was apparently ‚Äúso concerned about me‚Äù‚Äìso I
did‚ÄìDusty freakin hung up on me not even 30 seconds into our conversation.
It was bs. Then I looked back at the messages Dusty had sent me while I was
driving back home in response to the single message I had sent him while I
was in town and I realized Dusty had set it all up for him to be able to
essentially social engineer the police. (Acting like he was a mormon with
kids in his responses back to me while I was driving, which he later shared
with the police, when in reality he‚Äôs an atheist with no kids, etc) So I
called the police letting them know that Dusty had lied to them and he
could have very well just hacked them whereas social engineering is
actually how he hacked me. #suicide #plot #rubbingitin #sabotage


A few days later my superior at work invited me to goto the Eagles bar with
him that night at 7pm. I said I would go. This was when we were working on
my computer being hacked at work and I had been issued a brand new
computer--and I was being careful as hell with even potentially re-exposing
the new computer to any viruses through any of my other potentially
infected devices. Like I would go clear over to the other side of the room
just to turn bluetooth/wifi on on my phone just to avoid infecting the new
computer I had been issued, when getting a password off my personal phone
or whatever. I later found out that despite my best efforts, the new
computer showed similar signs of being infected. (I think my brother could
have hacked their whole network but I don‚Äôt know that forsure) Anyways, I
went home that night after being invited to the Eagles and I recall I was
on one of my computers doing something around 7:20pm that night when the
same kid knocked/rang the doorbell for the seventh time. My network was
down at the time so this time, once I saw who it was, I started recording
on my cell phone instead prior to answering. Sure enough it was the same
kid again, only this time I saw who was directing him myself in walking out
with my cell phone camera rolling.

All previous times I had recorded my encounters with that kid with my ring
video doorbell which stayed put in one location. It was the child abuser
neighbor guy who was directing the kid. As soon as that child abuser guy
saw me he tucked back into his garage so he couldn‚Äôt be recorded, I saw him
myself but I don‚Äôt think I captured him on my cell phone footage. The kid
initially said something like ‚Äúwhy you always working?‚Äù, (as if to coerce
me to goto the bar seems I was running a little late to goto the bar with
my co-worker that evening) but then after his dad tucked behind their
garage door, the kid looked back for direction and didn‚Äôt know what to do
once he saw his dad was now gone. #plot

I would be willing to bet the kid‚Äôs dad had been standing right there every
single time that kid came to my house--because it had become clear to me
the kid was being directed. (Which is partly why I call that guy a child
abuser, because he directs his kid to do shady things and because he
clearly had hurt his kids physically previously)

Anyways, the significance of what the kid said this time was the kid was
essentially coercing me to goto the bar where I would later be poisoned,
given how I was late to go to the eagles that evening. #plot

The kid hasn‚Äôt come by again since I found out who was sending him and
reported him, not like that anyways, maybe on halloween with his whole
family‚Äìthat halloween video was deleted however‚Äìnot by me. #signal

Describe eagles bar poisoning incident in full here..

One thing I want to add right now about the eagles bar poisoning is I
suspect they ended up getting in my car while I was at the eagles and put
poison in there, (Either while at the eagles or while I was at walmart
later‚Äìor both) I suspect they also left a bunch of thorn-bush spikes on my
floormat that I later dumped out thinking they were odd whereas I hadn‚Äôt
been near any thornbushes at all lately and whereas I hadn‚Äôt had any thorn
bush spikes on any of my pant legs or shoes or anything--let alone that
many of them. How else did they get in there? It was only after one of the
next poisonings where they left similar thorn bush spikes on my porch when
I put two and two together, that that would be a great way for someone to
get poison into me internally--and that those thornbush spikes were likely
left there deliberately both times--even though the main poisoning in the
eagles incident came from them leaving some heat activated clear substance
on I think like my shifter in my car, which I ended up getting exposed to 2
separate times because at first I thought it was from a guy who came and
touched me in the bar that night right before I left the eagles--when in
reality it was that same guy who came and touched me in the bar that night
although I suspect he had been in my car prior--because my whole car had
wreaked like this one guy‚Äôs cologne. I suspect him coming to touch me
before he left was essentially him letting me know who was responsible like
they all like to do‚Äìthrough his cologne. His cologne was very distinct and
there was no way for my whole car to smell like his cologne from just him
barely touching me and standing next to me for a minute that evening. #car
#poison #plot


The significance of the thorn bush spikes is what happened to my dad before
he died? He got some strange ‚Äúinfection‚Äù in his foot--leading to him having
to get his big toe cut off. Which occured right around the time my brother
Dusty had been denied going to Alaska fishing with us. #poison?

When they were in my car at the eagles is when I suspect they added the
capabilities to track my location through my car, or they did something to
my car while they were in there I suspect‚Äìthey never just do one thing they
always seem to like plan ahead or something. It‚Äôs also when I suspect they
stole my garage door opener which they later used to get into my house on
at least one occasion--before I found out it had gone missing.

This is the time where the poison pulled all the blood from my
extremities‚Äìeagles incident--on my second exposure to be specific. The
first exposure I felt while in the middle of walmart right after I left the
eagles that night and it made me feel drugged. The substance was a clear
liquidy substance that doesn‚Äôt feel like liquid to the touch. The first
exposure I noticed from feeling drugged out of nowhere in the middle of
walmart that evening‚Äìeven though I had only had one drink that night at the
bar. (Karie went to bars too on occasion btw) From past experiences, I knew
I had to wash it off immediately. So in walmart after starting to feel all
funny I knew I had to go directly to the bathroom to wash off my hands and
where that guy had touched me. Then I started feeling better. The second
exposure that night or the next day legit pulled all the blood from my
extremities. I noticed the second exposure from looking at my vape later on
while at home, there was some clear substance all over my hands and my
vape. Like my hands didn‚Äôt even feel wet at all to where I likely wouldn‚Äôt
have even noticed it had I not seen it all over my vape. I washed it off
immediately again but even still it almost wasn‚Äôt soon enough‚Äìit almost
killed me. It pulled all the blood from my toes up my feet, my fingers
going up my arms; I couldn‚Äôt pee for hours even though I had to because I
did not have enough blood flow down there either. I had to sit down as well
cuz I started getting all light headed‚Äìit was scary. And I washed it off as
soon as I noticed it on my vape that evening. #suicide #plot

These guys will try and create distractions as well to try and make me look
bad btw, the hardest part is seeing through all their distractions and
getting to the real meat of what they are ultimately trying to do and
figuring out when/where they did something exactly‚Äìjust know they have the
capabilities to get in my car anytime I‚Äôm in a store for even like ten
minutes‚Äìand they have gotten in my car countless times now I suspect.
Therefore, they may have even gotten in my car a second time while I was in
walmart that night or gotten into my house that night for instance, which
could have been when/where they added the second substance. That‚Äôs the
thing‚Äìwith that kind of capability it makes it difficult to nail down
exactly when they did what, and where they did what. Cuz they could have
spread it out across multiple locations. They use false flag operations
pretty regularly. This incident as a whole was not a false flag operation,
but exactly when/where they exposed me might have been. Then in addition to
all that, most all their poisons typically seem to consist of a cocktail of
whatever it may be. So as to essentially decrease their odds of getting
caught. For instance, say it was really poison, but say they added some
drug that can seep through your skin to the poison cocktail. (Which would
also aid in disorienting the individual) Then when the person goes to the
doctor the next day complaining about being poisoned, the doctor drug tests
them or something. As soon as the doctor sees they have drugs in their
system the doctor won‚Äôt believe them anymore‚Äìeven though it was really the
perpetrators who unwittingly drugged them. I have gone to the doctor after
every instance described herein btw. This last time the instacare told me
only the emergency room could test for stuff like that, so next time I know
where to go now but again‚Äìthey could rig it to where I would be better off
just not going in. That‚Äôs the challenge with these guys. I like got to walk
this tight rope and avoid getting knocked down from either direction.

So yea, I try not to say even one thing that could even possibly be
maliciously mis-interpreted anymore as me being depressed or whatever to
avoid my brother trying to kill me again and using it as an excuse for my
death.
String of break-ins #1 - Murder by Overdose Plot

Thorn bush spikes added to my porch--one of which I barely stepped on.

Tried to frame me as a druggy by planting paraphernalia in my house and by
somehow lighting off a smell bomb or something which made my whole house
reak like drugs‚Äìlike it was crazy. #overdose #plot

Put something in my vape juice.

Tampered with my prescriptions.

Tampered with literally anything and everything they could in my house.

I suspect this is when they installed the gassing capabilities to my
furnace. #tampering #furnace

All cameras showed completely blank for over a full day--even the hard
wired ones--which was unheard of. (I had been staying in a hotel to try and
get away from all the EMF stuff)

Wet spot in the middle of the walkway on the carpet in one of my
bedrooms‚Äìeven though I had been gone for at least 24 hours--which I also
stepped on. Between the wet spot and the thorn bush spike I barely stepped
on, I started feeling all wobbly. Vape juice made me feel drugged a little
later.

It was as if they planned on the thorn bush spike, wet spot they had left
for me to kill me, and they had set it all up to frame me to the police as
being a druggy when they later found me.

I didn‚Äôt drive my car for days afterwards because I was afraid they had
succeeded in drugging me that evening.

Gave evidence to the police.

Halloween Car Break-in/Vape Juice Tampering/Mocking me

I suspect a black guy in a black mercedes car got into my car while in
walmart and put something in my vape juice after the latest breakins. He
and his girlfriend were sitting in their car next to my car when I went out
that day and I recognized that car as being one of my brother‚Äôs guys. Right
after this is when they left that voicemail mocking me by coughing or
whatever. They have since left other voicemails as well, the latest one I
actually listened to sounds like it‚Äôs being created by a dj. I do have the
evidence.

Tampering with my electricity

I suspect they‚Äôve been able to remotely control my electricity previously,
by they I mean my brother and his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù. They also have rigged my
electricity previously to like make it feel like static electricity for a
while in here, to make all my outlets begin to spark whenever I‚Äôd plug
something in, to make my lights behave as though I had an open neutral, all
my light bulbs started going out prematurely, to aid in emf-ing me, and to
be able to I suspect power some of their electronic bugs they had on the
exterior of my house previously through the open neutral essentially. I
suspect they used their ability to remotely turn on and off my electricity
to help get by some of my cameras previously, and I recall they would
actually use their ability to control my power as yet another ‚Äúsignal‚Äù to
let me know when I was doing something they didn‚Äôt like previously. (Like
texting my little sister Taylor about how I thought our brother was a
serial killer for instance, my power went off and on as soon as I texted
her that, etc) I do believe that child abuser guy might have something to
do with all the power tampering.

Radiation poisoning

I can no longer grow hair from the front of each of my calves all the way
around my leg to the inner side, (so I can no longer grow hair on like 80
percent of my calves) nor can I grow hair on the backs of my thighs. Loss
of hair growth is one symptom of radiation poisoning, radiation apparently
attacks the fast growing cells first.
Infrasound
Keys

I suspect they stole my keychain out of my car most recently, which had
keys to all my rental properties, my new safe, my house, my mailbox, etc,
etc.

My rental house has since been having a lot of issues with it‚Äôs
furnace/water heater.

As of December 15, 2021

[Opinion]

My brother is trying to kill me you guys. Like I know that sounds bad, but
I swear it‚Äôs the truth. Do you know how much money and time his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù
have spent on me? It‚Äôs insane. I swear its like all they do, some of them
at least. Sometimes I become desensitized like I said, but the truth is I
can‚Äôt grow hair on like half of my legs anymore--which isn‚Äôt normal. Most
older men can still grow hair on their legs--let alone men my age. I know
deep down this is no joke.

Sometimes I suspect they may still be getting into my house despite my best
efforts to keep them out. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just PTSD or whether I‚Äôm
still being re-exposed to something they did previously while in my house
somehow or else whether it‚Äôs from my car or what. All of this likely
implicates way more than just my brother too. But hardly anybody is going
to truly take this all seriously until it ultimately happens. That‚Äôs the
position I find myself in. The worst part is my brother has ripped apart
our whole family.

These guys can hack anything--you have been warned. It‚Äôs scary. I suspect
they buy exploits off of the dark web btw, I don‚Äôt think they program
everything from scratch‚Äìbut I do think they have programming knowledge to
say the least.

I wish I knew the name of what hacking gang or mob or cult or whatever it
is these guys belong to. Because these guys are extremely dangerous. Some
of them seem to be like hired contractors or hitmen, whereas others seem to
be more persistent in nature. (Like the black mercedes black guy and the
child abuser guy) But going after people seems to be legit all this hacking
gang does all day every day. Most hackers aren‚Äôt killers but the two
together are a deadly mix. Especially when the hackers act as the
coordinators for people on the ground. My brother really had no reason to
hack me other than if he wanted to kill me.

Do you want to know who‚Äôs websites my brother has done previously btw?
Karie‚Äôs and my father‚Äôs. Crazy right? I wonder if he hacked them while
doing their websites too.

Regardless, I hope someone takes all this and runs with it and holds my
brother and everyone else who has been involved accountable some day,
assuming they are indeed guilty as I strongly suspect--don‚Äôt let them fool
you. If I can do anything further to help, just let me know. If my brother
and any other key members of this unnamed group are one day held
responsible--it will have all been worth it. Even just raising the alarm
like this is huge. Hopefully when I‚Äôm done with all this then people can
make up their own minds about my brother and whatever happens to me from
here on out. My fear is a lot of what I have shared here is electronic at
the end of the day, and it could therefore be hacked and manipulated and
therefore it could be argued to not be authentic in court--when in fact
everything I‚Äôve written here is authentic--I just could still do it in a
more official way is all I guess. I‚Äôll do that on the key parts once I‚Äôm
through. But then I need to get out of here for my own safety and leave
this all behind me I think, in pursuit of happiness elsewhere.

Regardless, thank you for your support.

As of December 17, 2021

I need to be careful about what I add here‚ÄìDusty doesn‚Äôt respond to some
things or else he brushes things off for a reason. The last thing I want to
do is be framed or have something I say be used to get my brother off. This
is all electronic at the end of the day and I have proven hacking. So I‚Äôm
hoping this will just help serve as a guide to the police if they want to
dig further themselves more than anything. I went out on a lim in sharing
all this with everyone including the police, partly because I know I didn‚Äôt
do anything wrong, and partly because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do, and
partly because I really would like the police‚Äôs help in all this. I really
have been confronted with an extremely challenging situation when you think
about it. Life‚Äôs nothing but a game of smarts to my brother‚ÄìI really wish
it weren‚Äôt that way. It makes it that much harder for people like me to do
the right thing and come forward against him‚Äìbecause the whole thing is
rigged in his favor essentially.

What do I do? Just brush off everything he does to me? Run away? Don‚Äôt
report it? I don‚Äôt know what to do tbh. Just like with the gangstalking,
the more I bring up what all I suspect my brother may have done and my
suspicions of him‚Äìthe more I make myself look bad. It‚Äôs scary. But what is
the alternative? Just not report any of my suspicions about my brother nor
anything he relentlessly does to me? Play dumb? What do I do? What I want
to do is to live a normal life without having to devote all my time to my
brother, without having to devote all my time just to staying alive, etc;
my brother who is constantly trying to kill me/frame me. But devoting my
whole life to my brother is the only way I‚Äôll ever get a smoking gun on him
and therefore it‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll ever be able to get him to stop,
whereas he appears to devote his whole life to me regardless of what I do
essentially. (Or else he pays someone to devote their whole lives to me)
It‚Äôs an almost untenable position to be faced with. I‚Äôm in this position
because I am smart and observant myself at the end of the day‚Äìbut Dusty
uses that fact against me. I‚Äôve never been smarter than my brother. I
really need someone to help guide me through all this and safely.

Dusty never stops you guys. He has all the information too through all his
hacking, like I don‚Äôt have 1/1000th of the information on him as he has on
me these days. I don‚Äôt even know where he‚Äôs at right now for instance‚Äìand
he uses that to mislead me and/or to make me look bad to other people
because he knows all I know at this stage is what he tells me. Plus he has
exponentially more resources than me. He also has way more time than me.
(Cuz I actually have a day job, (software team lead) I have two day jobs
really, (+property mgr) three if you count constantly having to defend
myself from my brother‚Äôs posse (++staying alive))

The hackers seemed particularly disturbed when I wrote the section about
Tom Finn and my garage above btw.

Do you know how many ways coming forward with all this could end badly for
me, assuming I‚Äôm right on all this, given Dusty has such an advantage over
me?

I could be framed and locked up for the very thing I‚Äôm trying to bring to
light that I now suspect my brother has done to our family.

I could be deemed crazy and lose all my assets from incapacity.

I could be killed.

I could lose friends.

I could be sued.

I could have my reputation ruined.

I could be charged for some other thing that I didn‚Äôt even know was illegal.

Like this is no good choice for anybody, it‚Äôs my only choice at this point
however‚Äìif I want any chance at ever being able to live a happy life again.

It‚Äôs like a one in a million shot at me actually getting a desirable
outcome. But I am doing it because I have no other options at this point.
They tell you to stay silent for a reason‚Äìmy brother stays silent for a
reason.

But what about when you are able to put two and two together before the
police are able to? Because you were there as a witness? And the person you
suspect was behind some shady stuff knows that you have figured out their
shady past? So then they start pursuing you trying to discredit you and/or
kill/frame you daily? Then what? What would you do if you were me? Stay
silent? Run? Then my brother could just frame you or kill you and the
police would have no idea about the other side of the story until it‚Äôs too
late.

Some people don‚Äôt think I should devote as much time to this either, and I
honestly wish I didn‚Äôt have to. But the truth is I have no other choice at
this point because my brother never quits‚Äìand therefore this is necessary
if I ever want to not have to worry about my brother coming after me ever
again.

Them getting in my house is a huge freaking deal cuz they could try to
frame me yet again, not to mention everything else they‚Äôve been doing to me.

If I had a choice, I wouldn‚Äôt be doing all this. But I don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôd much prefer to just live a normal life‚Äìbut my brother won‚Äôt freaking
let me.

I wish I had any other male human being on this planet as a brother tbh.

Doing the right thing is never easy, but I‚Äôm hoping in the end it will be
worth it, and I'm hoping someone is looking over me.

(I‚Äôm going to be moving this readme to git to try and avoid tampering and
to avoid everything being read by people who have shown signs of covering
for my brother btw, (the last thing I need is everyone being on the same
page in their denials, etc) so watch out for that. Git has version
histories built into it that all can see)

My Analysis of TimelineFather

As for our father‚Äôs death, the whole reason our dad told us we had to move
out at the time was because of Cindy threatening to leave him or something.
The whole thing just seems like a plot between my brother and Cindy. Like
it‚Äôs just too convenient in a way. It‚Äôs almost as if it was all set up to
be that way. Like it gave Dusty an excuse to bounce as soon as he did as
well. I still don‚Äôt know why Cindy told our dad she wanted us to move out
to begin with in order to stay with our father either. Dusty and Cindy were
always close‚Äìeven after she was going to divorce our father, from what I
recall. Like for me, that‚Äôs messed up that Cindy was going to divorce our
father when he was down like that and I have my father‚Äôs back in regards to
all that‚Äìplus, I rarely even talked to Cindy at the time. I wasn‚Äôt
impressed with Cindy‚Äôs biker bar and her having biker dudes over shortly
after his death, etc. Not to mention like everything that happened the day
of my father‚Äôs death.

How could Cindy have beat Annie and I to the hospital when she was
supposedly in Ogden at the time unless Dusty called her prior to calling
the paramedics? I know some of Dusty‚Äôs friends said he called them right
after he discovered our father or something too. I don‚Äôt know, I guess
Cindy could have been already on her way home or something but it‚Äôs almost
as if some time passed or something that isn‚Äôt accounted for, assuming you
take both Dusty‚Äôs and Cindy‚Äôs alibis at face value. Cindy said she was in
Ogden at her biker bar. Dusty said he went to the gas station nearby, which
was literally like 2 minutes away. So like a ten minute round trip or so.
And when he came back he found our dad that way. I‚Äôm assuming when he left
for the gas station our dad wasn‚Äôt there. Also it just seems too convenient
for them both to have not been there at the time. It‚Äôs as if they planned
it to be that way.

It‚Äôs almost as if Dusty called Cindy or something when he did first find
our father is all I‚Äôm saying‚Äìwith the specific purpose of having her cover
for him on the autopsy. Then he waited to call the paramedics until Cindy
was in range. And he didn‚Äôt goto the hospital cuz he already knew our dad
was dead essentially, either that or I guess he could have been busy being
questioned by the police, idk if the police even really questioned him
though tbh. But yea, then it‚Äôs almost as if Dusty played the victim to
avoid being asked too much about his discovery of our father from anybody.
And it worked cuz at the time, nobody really even questioned Dusty. Cindy,
Dusty, and possibly Shawn would likely have known that had it been Cindy
who had found our father, more questions would have been raised. I recall
Cindy used to always watch Law and Order.

I just don‚Äôt get Dusty‚Äôs infatuation with Cindy. I will say, when those
guys would stay up and drink together, my father would either not be around
or else he‚Äôd go to sleep early. So I could totally see Shawn and Cindy
talking with Dusty about something like all this late one night and Dusty
even taking Cindy‚Äôs side over our father‚Äôs. Cindy had been charged with
like fraud or something a few years prior as an insurance broker, losing
her license. While I like Cindy, I have always looked at her and Shawn as
being a little shady, and I‚Äôve always looked at Cindy as somewhat of a gold
digger. And all this just made me question how convenient an occurrence it
really was for her to have my father die right when he did given their
ongoing divorce discussions at the time. (I do believe my father had a
prenup in place with Cindy) I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Dusty and Cindy did
something together late one night either‚Äìbut I have no knowledge of
anything of the sort. I don‚Äôt know what Dusty was referring to about our
dad was almost going to change his trust before he died, when he said that
repeatedly at the time, or how my brother even would have known that given
our dad only ever really talked to me about his trust once that I recall,
(he said i‚Äôd likely be getting a house or something) I think our dad
intentionally didn‚Äôt talk to us too much about his trust for a reason. But
I would assume if my dad had been planning to change anything on his trust
at the time‚Äìthen it would have likely been to remove Cindy. I‚Äôm really
hoping Dusty didn‚Äôt treat our father like he did Karie right before Karie
died, or like he‚Äôs now treating me.

My brother had demonized our dad prior to this point, he held resentment
towards our father both for not being there when we were little, and for
our father ‚Äúmaking‚Äù Dusty follow in our father‚Äôs footsteps. (Our father
didn‚Äôt make Dusty do anything btw) I could totally see someone like Cindy
using psychology to amp up or leverage my brother‚Äôs resentment against our
father as well. I therefore do think part of my brother‚Äôs motivation is
also to ruin our father‚Äôs legacy, and to snub our father for ‚Äúmaking‚Äù dusty
become a civil engineer, as you will see..

Sister

As for Karie‚Äôs death, Dusty and Cindy both hated Karie. I was always more
on Karie‚Äôs side, like I hung out with Karie more than I hung out with Cindy
after my father‚Äôs death‚Äìand even before our father‚Äôs death I tended to side
with Karie. Everyone that Dusty starts demonizing has seemingly died
btw‚Äìbesides my mother who now covers for him. It‚Äôs almost as if Dusty got
smarter in Karie‚Äôs case, and realized it would be better for him if he
weren‚Äôt even around the person.

tbc

Me

I know my brother very well‚Äìyou have got to take that into consideration
when considering all of this. I know him as well as anybody. I know when he
is lying. I know when he‚Äôs being shady. I know how smart he is. I also know
how he thinks he‚Äôs smarter than everybody. As for my brother‚Äôs subsequent
targeting of me, it all lines up‚ÄìI simply know too much for my brother‚Äôs
comfort or something. I am now a liability to him/them. Plus he is jealous
and he doesn‚Äôt want me continuing my father‚Äôs legacy. In addition to the
potential monetary reasons. When my brother blamed my mother for him being
this way, he was blaming my mother for the fact that Dusty only really
cares about himself. Dusty has essentially admitted a lot of this in subtle
ways, ways in which only his victims would know the true meaning of‚Äìgiven
only his victims have the required context. But he always spreads it out
across at least 2 different platforms. For instance, I recall shortly after
first accusing Dusty of all this over email, he replied over imessage just
out of the blue at one point ‚Äúyou‚Äôre smart‚Äù only to delete it after. Dusty
enjoys having his victims and only his victims know he is ultimately
responsible, it must make him feel powerful or something.

I suspect Dusty went into sleeper mode when I purchased Taylor‚Äôs commercial
building, which Cindy did seem to be questioning whether it was the right
thing for Taylor to do at our purchase finalization dinner that Dusty
didn‚Äôt show up to, even though if I recall correctly, the whole reason
Taylor wanted to sell it to begin with was due to Cindy convincing Taylor
of the value of annuities. I recall Dusty wasn‚Äôt really happy about me
purchasing it shortly thereafter either‚Äìbut I had that dinner for a
reason‚Äìto ensure Taylor really wanted to sell it after having ample time to
think it through and to see the unit she was selling first hand in person
alongside me.

I think Dusty started distancing himself from me at this time based on all
he‚Äôs learned in the past and all he was planning to do to me. He realized
it would be better for him if he didn‚Äôt associate with me if he were going
to start coming after me, to avoid questioning later.

tbc


As for any questions about me.

I‚Äôll just say I wasn‚Äôt really even into computers at the time of my dads
death so I had no way to know about the dark web nor how to get anything
like that at the time‚Äînor did I have any motive. Dusty has always been into
computers and programming and Dusty has always been all butt hurt about the
past. I‚Äôve never been all butt hurt about anything relating to the past
really‚ÄìDusty is just that way. I don‚Äôt hold any resentment towards my
father whatsoever‚ÄîI honestly really wish my father were still around to
help me get through this today. And I wish he were around longer just in
general so I could have learned from him more than I did‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve said
numerous times previously. Plus, I wouldn‚Äôt have pushed for an autopsy had
I had something I was concerned about them finding in my father‚Äîit really
is that simple. How was Cindy so sure our father overdosed that day
anyways? Seems like a smear campaign meant to cover up the truth to me‚Äîthe
whole ordeal seems fishy to me‚Äìespecially when you consider what‚Äôs been
happening to me lately..

As for karie, I mean I‚Äôm the one who thanked her for being our trustee on
her deathbed, and for helping me get through college. If I held that much
resentment towards karie, it would show‚Äîbut it doesn‚Äôt‚Äîbecause I don‚Äôt.
Dusty still hates Karie to this very day. I also will say I‚Äôm not the one
who grabbed her by her freaking bald head while she were at her weakest
point on her deathbed as if I were happy she were in that horrible state
and I‚Äôm not the one infatuated with sending ‚Äúsignals‚Äù‚Äîmy brother is. I
don‚Äôt hide that I‚Äôm a programmer now either‚ÄîI code my ass off but it‚Äôs
mostly all for rent dynamics as all the GitHub reporting shows. One person
can only code so much at the end of the day. Plus I‚Äôve never been a
hacker‚Äîi haven‚Äôt had time to. I‚Äôm not the one who takes time off around
all the deaths in my family either. I‚Äôm not the one who freakin starts a
fake recording studio just to act as a front to what I‚Äôm really doing. And
I‚Äôm not the one who stopped being a civil engineer just to spite my father.
Like what more do you even need to know? I treated karie with the dignity
and respect she deserved. Plus I don‚Äôt recall my brother even showing me
the dark web until right around the time karie died anyways. (Not sure on
the exact date he showed us that, but even if it was right before she
died‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt dig into it myself really until Dusty started coming after me
years later like I said‚Äîjust to see what he may be capable of later) I
honestly wish karie were still around to help me through all this as well.

It‚Äôs a complex dynamic, just like with any family. But looking back over
everything, do I think my brother would frame me? Now I freaking do‚Äîhell
yea‚Äîthat‚Äôs what‚Äôs so shocking to me in all this. It‚Äôs like my brother has
been like this imposter all along‚Äîonly ever truly caring about himself. (He
seems to care about Cindy too I guess‚Äîwhich is just so odd to me‚Äîlike Cindy
is the only parent/step parent he has never ever talked down on like ever)
Its devastating to now find out that even my only 100 percent full
brother/sibling has likely never ever really even truly loved me‚Äîeven the
years I thought he loved me‚ÄîI was wrong. It hurts. And that‚Äôs why this is
such a big freaking deal to me is because I now know these guys will try
and frame me for what I now suspect they‚Äôve done, and they actually know
what they‚Äôve done whereas I still don‚Äôt know what substances they are
using, I can only give my best guess based on what they‚Äôve since done to
me‚Äîso again they have the upper hand, let alone everything else they have
been doing to me beyond just trying to frame me. And I‚Äôm only one person at
the end of the day. I refuse to be my brother's ‚Äúfall‚Äù guy, that‚Äôs
apparently what he‚Äôs been trying to make me for years now‚Äîand the evidence
clearly shows that. Guess where I learned the term ‚Äúfall guy‚Äù? My brother.

These guys clearly know how to do all this in a way to where little
questions are asked and where they are able to get away with stuff and
avoid questioning themselves. Now that they are faced with someone who
actually knows what they have done, I mean they‚Äôve changed their strategy a
little bit but seemingly not all that much. If anything, they‚Äôve set the
whole thing up to where I would inevitably know what they‚Äôve done
eventually and on their timing. I‚Äôve now seen their different strategies
play out again and again first hand, and I‚Äôm now being tortured
daily/discredited daily as a result‚Äîhence why I have now reached the
conclusions I have is because my brother has essentially forced me to reach
these conclusions. Why else would they be coming after me? It is my brother
I know that it is‚ÄìI know my brother better than arguably anybody. If they
were goody two shoes at the end of the day they wouldn‚Äôt even know how to
come after me to begin with. (Kinda like how I don‚Äôt even know where to
even begin in going after my brother) If I were them on the other hand, I
would have way more options than what I have right now‚Äîand ‚Äúfaking‚Äù a
gangstalking would be among the worst of my options. Seems if I were them
it would have to be a fake, and if I were them I would have all the options
they do. (To be clear‚ÄìI‚Äôve never faked anything)

Let‚Äôs take a look at all their options real quick:


 1.

 ‚ÄúFucking stop‚Äù, as I‚Äôve begged them to do numerous times now thereby
 giving me no real reason to turn them in or even really suspect them in the
 first place really. If I were them‚ÄîI would have definitely taken this
 option.
 2.

 Kill me to silence me, then they could plant something or something to
 try and discredit me as well.
 3.

 Frame me using all their advanced insight, resources, and hacking
 abilities
 4.

 What else? Write to the police everything they‚Äôve done line by line in
 real time accusing me? Yea right. They know that would backfire on them
 bigly assuming they are guilty.
 5.

 Try to discredit me/make me look crazy by gangstalking ME
 6.

 ‚ÄúFake‚Äù like THEY are victims of gangstalking THEMSELVES to try and make
 it look like it‚Äôs not them when nobody had even accused them of anything
 anyways? Yea fucking right. That would only discredit them anyways.
 7.

 Force me out of town, force me to quit my jobs, etc; like they have been
 trying to do, along with framing me, gangstalking me, discrediting me, and
 trying to kill me. (Essentially an ‚Äúall the above‚Äù option among those above
 that are even noteworthy‚Äîall the noteworthy options besides the ‚Äúfucking
 stop‚Äù option‚Äîthis ‚Äúall the above‚Äù option is the option they have seemingly
 chosen)


As opposed to my one option:


 1.

 Trust your instincts, your gut, and what the evidence is showing as to
 what these people are doing to you every single fucking day, trust what you
 suspect they have likely also done to your family given how they are now
 doing it to you repeatedly, etc, and figure out a way to document
 everything fully and get it all to the police despite all the hacking‚Äîwhile
 risking potential insanity allegations, risking losing all your assets,
 risking being framed, risking your life, etc, etc‚Äîall in hopes of actually
 being able to have a desirable/just/happy life/outcome again one day that
 will also help protect the rest of your family.


Thats it. That‚Äôs my option. That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing btw.

I for damn sure wouldn‚Äôt be writing all this in real time if I were them.
And I for damn sure wouldn‚Äôt live in Logan anymore starting a long time ago
if I were them. (Kinda like Dusty and Cindy both bounced shortly after my
fathers death) I hope you see the pattern in that the people being targeted
come to Logan for safety, both to ensure whoever is doing all this is held
accountable one day and because we feel safest here. The people doing the
attacking on the other hand are going to feel safest elsewhere‚Äîit‚Äôs just
human nature. Plus, there really is only one group of people who HAVE NOT
been poisoned or killed left standing, out of the natural divides within my
father‚Äôs family, in my opinion‚Äîif I were you, I would look to the remaining
tribe for suspects, you know, the tribe who has not had all this bad shit
happening to them..

I‚Äôll give you a clue, I‚Äôm the only one left in the hacked/poisoned/killed
tribe of my fathers family‚ÄîI always sided with my father over Cindy‚Äîsame
with Karie. Dusty has always sided with Cindy.

I‚Äôm also quite shocked Dusty thought so little of my cognitive ability and
my ability to protect myself and my family.

As of December 16, 2021

I suspect they followed me to Cache Valley Bank today, around 1:46pm.

As of December 17, 2021

I woke up with my right arm burning today. (Which was the side I was laying
on in bed) They may have gotten in my house again, I read in gangstalking
it‚Äôs common for them to use tunnels. I also read it‚Äôs common for them to
use microchips. Not saying that‚Äôs what they are doing though. I do suspect
them putting something on my bedding is what may have contributed to my
loss of hair on my legs previously and my arm burning this morning‚Äìwell
that and/or all the emf stuff.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17bzBc6v8X\_Oijsj2hLYF4LJavrScWmaU?usp=sharing
(Notice how the missing hair coincides with where my bare legs would touch
my bedding on any given night)

Again sometimes they‚Äôll do false flag operations. Or operations
specifically intended to make me look bad knowing I‚Äôll likely report what
happens to me.

To get to the bottom of all this, you could try having a sincere talk with
that child abuser guy who has seemingly been a part of it since the very
beginning‚Äîat least in regards to what‚Äôs been happening to me anyway‚Äìand if
you are able to find out everything he knows without letting him mislead
you at all then I think you could honestly find out a lot. Just a thought.
That eagles incident is pretty damning after all, not to mention everything
else I can link back to that guy and how I can link him back to my brother
through all the hacking, eagles incident, kid coming over repeatedly on
dates that only someone who is deeply familiar with me would know, all the
intimidation, deletion of videos, etc, etc. (At least preliminarily)

Not only do they fine tune their attacks to the individual‚Äìthey seem to
fine tune their attacks to the individual circumstances at the time of that
particular individual. I have no doubt they could figure out a way to
attack any person through all their hacking and intel.

As of December 18, 2021

Power bill was up again for no reason in November when I just checked,
after I started leaving all my power breakers on again starting probably ‚Öì
of the way through November. (Meaning it could have even been higher than
this if all my breakers had been on like normal for the full month of
November)

It‚Äôs as if someone is somehow somewhere drawing from my power or
something.. (Attic or garage or electrical meter maybe? None of which were
covered in bug sweep‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think the guy even really bug sweeped my water
heater tbh)

As of December 20, 2021

I‚Äôm breaking out in hives today on my back. See what I amended above under
the ‚Äúas of November 12, 2021‚Äù heading for more info. I‚Äôll add a similar
but more elaborate quote of what I put above here:

 -

 as of 12/20/2021‚Äî I suspect they‚Äôve now moved back to external
 poisonings which won‚Äôt even wash off‚Äînot even with rubbing alcohol or apple
 cider vinegar‚Äîand which aren‚Äôt immediately apparent you‚Äôve been
 attacked‚Äìbut have a similar texture/feeling when they are on your hands.
 (So now I got to figure out what in the hell will successfully wash off
 this new substance and all the chemistry or whatever involved with soaps
 and different kinds of oils, etc, etc‚Äîif I want to freaking get it off me
 fully‚Äìread the bullet points below‚ÄìI guess it‚Äôs in my best interest NOT to
 research this or continue trying to get it off me at his point after all)
 -

 A better description of their overall pattern is that they will always
 fine tune what they are doing or evolve what they are doing at any given
 time using all their intel gleaned through all their hacking. (So what they
 are doing constantly changes based on their latest intel‚Äîa lot of times
 they‚Äôll change up what they are doing just to try and make me look bad or
 to try and make a statement I have made previously proven false, like going
 back to external poisonings after I said in general they seem to be going
 from external to internal over time‚Äîwhat I should have said is they always
 evolve what they are doing based on their latest intel) Now that is
 something I can say definitively that they won‚Äôt be able to then turn
 around and try and make me look bad about, is their methods are always
 changing based on their latest intel essentially, to best suit them and to
 best suit the picture they are trying to paint or whatever their end game
 is.. They also constantly exploit vulnerabilities as well‚Äîboth in the
 digital and the physical realm.
 -

 By exploiting vulnerabilities in the physical realm I mean for instance
 they‚Äôll get in my safe leading me to get a new more secure safe then
 they‚Äôll steal my keys, or else they‚Äôll start emf-ing me until I figure out
 a way to block it successfully, then they‚Äôll use like a different type of
 emf like ef or rf which goes right through the existing defenses I have in
 place, or else they‚Äôll reposition their attacks at that time to maybe come
 in at another angle that I hadn‚Äôt covered all that well, and once I figure
 out how to block all that then they‚Äôll start infrasounding me instead which
 requires a whole different approach to try and block out, etc‚Äîall with the
 intent of having a continuous ongoing pressure or torture (It‚Äôs an
 intelligence game of my brothers like I said, it requires knowledge of all
 sorts of different things to advance on to the next stage and I am being
 forced to play for my life essentially‚Äîand I never even signed up for this
 to begin with‚Äîand it keeps getting harder)
 -

 I can now see it. My brother is essentially forcing me through these
 steps making me learn these things to frame me, only he‚Äôs doing it by
 actually doing these things to me‚Äîknowing his search history will never be
 found and mine will. ‚ö†Ô∏è But that would only help him for future murders
 essentially.. (Cuz I just searched how to get wax off my skin starting
 just yesterday or the day before when I woke up with hives and I noticed I
 had a waxy substance on my hands yet again that wouldn‚Äôt come off for days
 starting when I said I suspect they were still getting in my house‚Äîwhich is
 why I said that..) I guess framing me is yet another way for him to dismiss
 all my allegations against him. Then he poisons me every time I go out to
 essentially reinforce me to stay home and therefore not have anyone who can
 vouge for me. It‚Äôs like reverse psychology or something. This is a
 fucking nightmare tbh.

 Signing off for now, now that I think I have figured out what my brother
 is ultimately up to‚ÄìI mean it makes sense. I‚Äôve seen signs of them trying
 to frame me before. And now I write all this and can see it all in a
 relatively short overview and yea, I think that‚Äôs what is ultimately going
 on here. Now I‚Äôve got to ponder on how I can best defend against being
 framed going forward. I think the best way to defend against it is to
 entrust that‚Äôs really what he‚Äôs ultimately trying to do and just ignore it
 whenever I am poisoned/whenever I do have some strange substance on my hand
 out of nowhere. (They can put that stuff anywhere, on doorknobs for
 instance, and it‚Äôs not even immediately noticeable, etc) If I die from
 what‚Äôs left on my hand/body then I dunno, I guess so be it‚Äìbut even then he
 could blame me for it‚Äìomg. #worstbrotherever

 I‚Äôll try and provide all the references to this doc when I get a sec but
 then I‚Äôm better off having my devices shut off I think‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want Dusty
 to hurt anybody in my name‚Äìregardless of what I have to do to prevent that
 from happening. I think that‚Äôs my best move given the circumstances.

As of December 22, 2021

I think it‚Äôs in my best interest to keep writing these given I think they
are trying to frame me so what I notice could make the difference between
someone else‚Äôs life and death.

I went to Murray today to pick up my Lexus. They did a good job at cleaning
it but I don‚Äôt think they actually changed the signature of my key because
after I picked it up I had to get gas to make it back to Logan and in the
middle of me getting gas my car locked for no reason. I suspect the
attackers were there at the gas station across from Larry h miller Lexus in
Murray.

I also think it‚Äôs in my best interest not to go outside Logan anymore for a
while‚Äîwell after I fix my key. I just called them, the word must not have
gotten passed on to the service advisor correctly‚Äîhe said he could do it in
an hour and a half as soon as tomorrow. I think I might do that cuz it‚Äôs in
my best interest for them not to have ready access to my car at any given
point‚Äîespecially whereas they stole my keys.

I do also think it‚Äôs best for me to keep my computers off for the most
part. I tried resetting my one computer back to an old operating system
which doesn‚Äôt respect the option rom‚Äôs hashing algorithm and therefore
shouldn‚Äôt be fooled by any malware on the option rom that would be there if
the computer is rooted as I suspect, but it‚Äôs still a work in progress. And
even once I get passed that I still need a non infected network.
Thunderstrike 2 essentially roots itself to be loaded first thing, before
anything else. That‚Äôs how they are able to make it persist across factory
resets. I figured out that you‚Äôve got to go back to macOS Sierra or earlier
to make it so thunderstrike2 virus cannot fool the new operating system
installation into thinking the option rom is valid signed apple software
when it‚Äôs not‚Äîcuz the older versions don‚Äôt even check they just overwrite
the option rom software regardless essentially, based on my research
anyways. Then you got to make sure you are doing the installation on a non
infected network so they can‚Äôt reinfect it while it‚Äôs installing, and you
got to make sure you have a clean boot drive with a non corrupted version
of macOS downloaded from a non infected network. (Preferably) Then once you
go back to a clean version of like macOS Sierra or earlier and you are
confident the option rom efi has been rewritten, then you can install a new
fresh clean version of something like Big Sur or Monterey. And even still
it‚Äôs only a matter of connecting to the wrong network again and you could
be reinfected‚Äîand if you are me‚Äîthat could spell doom for you if so. So you
got to completely lock it down while you are confident it‚Äôs clean, so that
way it should take them longer to get it as reinfected as it was previously
again. (Take them longer to go through the privilege escalation steps, etc)

Someone just called me on one of my phones as I was typing this as well‚Äîno
response when I answered. They‚Äôve got to be planning something to try and
frame me or something. It‚Äôs not hard when they know literally everything
about me and in real time. I wish the police had that much capability tbh.

My brother texted me today as well. He always texts me at odd times. Like
the last time he texted me was the day of the bug sweep‚Äîthen his text was
deleted right after I noticed he had texted and said something about it to
the bug sweep guy. I‚Äôve got to figure out a way to block my brother again,
this time he texted me on my recently reset iphone so that‚Äôs probably why
he wasn‚Äôt blocked again yet on this phone at least. (I reset it trying to
get rid of the malware to no avail) In a way what he‚Äôs doing with all the
hacking, etc, does set me up to look suspicious when in reality I‚Äôm just
trying to avoid being a victim of his myself. I hope the police are
vigilant in this investigation and don‚Äôt just go after the low hanging
fruit cuz from what I gather, my brother is specifically trying to make me
look like low hanging fruit. At the end of the day you can put me away all
you want and it‚Äôs not going to resolve the underlying issue at hand‚Äîcuz
it‚Äôs not me‚Äîit‚Äôs him. I swear on my dog's grave/soul that it‚Äôs not me.
Dusty seemingly does this shit for a living and he‚Äôs good at it. I‚Äôm just
trying to help.

I still don‚Äôt even know what he put in my garage the last time Dusty was at
my house with me, when he brought his shady friend Tom Finn, and when they
first started acting all hostile towards me. But I have a feeling whatever
it was wasn‚Äôt good. If I knew what it was I‚Äôd give it to you.

Think what you want about the following pics/doc, but just know when the
bug sweeper guy saw this‚Äîhe knew it wasn‚Äôt just in my head. If it were in
my head‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt have had to make it this complex and feature specific.
This is where I have to sleep at nights these days if I want to get any
sleep at all. Each thing has a specific purpose‚Äîbut even still they still
have been getting through at times. Just know, I wouldn‚Äôt be sleeping in
this unless I had to. I want a family one day after all, this isn‚Äôt
necessarily the best thing to have to sleep in if you want to pick up
chicks. As of most recently, I‚Äôve found out a lot of the directed energy
stuff is coming from above, that‚Äôs what the heat signatures are saying at
least. (So it‚Äôs coming from either my attic or else a satellite, etc)

https://docs.google.com/file/d/16E4WgZUy9mRhwrt\_esRTI0mbFfGXf0Y7/edit?usp=docslist\_api&filetype=msword


P.s. I used to do painkillers but I quit‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt have come forward with
all this if I were on drugs. I used to be frustrated with my neighbors for
acting all suspicious of my garage and some for being rude to my dog turbo
until I realized I was likely framed by Dusty and Tom Finn putting
something in my garage. I had my frustrations with karie--we all did. The
difference is I'm open about it. But at the end of the day my love for
karie was far greater than my frustrations with karie. And I've never been
one to want to harm others. I suspect my brother is the opposite. I‚Äôm
concerned about Dusty‚Äôs actions more than his words. Me coming forward with
all this should be a testament to the fact that I care about karie and my
father. Sometimes I simply don't know how to best get that point across. I
do love Mormons otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have put them on my trust. Imagine
being completely innocent and being in my position. Like regardless of what
you think, just imagine that I am completely innocent and all this is
really happening to me for a second. It's as if Dusty has set me up to be
his fall guy or else he wants me dead. Think how terrifying that would
feel. I‚Äôm not perfect but I do my best with the cards I have been dealt.

As of December 23, 2021

I woke up in the middle of the night last night with my bowels and stomach
feeling as though they were about to explode. I went to the bathroom and
recall smelling a combination of almonds and diesel fuel. I didn‚Äôt eat
almonds nor drink diesel fuel. Could be just a coincidence, idk, but I
found it odd.

They may have gotten in my car one more time before the key signature was
changed, idk. All I know is that was strange to me, like not normal. Those
were main symptoms I experienced and I started feeling a little better
today.

I got my car key signature changed out today‚Äîthe only issue I‚Äôve since
realized is these guys still have my damn physical key (seems they stole m
whole keychain previously) so they can still get in my car manually.

God it sucks being targeted by this group. It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt even make
one mistake or you are screwed and have to sell your car or get a new
computer, phone, safe, etc‚Äîand they aren‚Äôt even going to get caught for
most everything they do to me.

I‚Äôve come to realize I may very well be one of the luckiest persons to
still be alive and in decent health. They‚Äôve tried poisoning me so many
different times now in so many different ways‚Äîit‚Äôs insane. Not to mention
all the emf/infrasound stuff and all their tampering with my house, etc.
I‚Äôve just made sure to try and be as careful as possible just in general
and then I always try and wash it off as best I can each time I‚Äôve had
reason to suspect I may have just been poisoned. Either I‚Äôm extremely lucky
or they are actively trying to frame/discredit me or both. I will say some
of the times I do feel like I most definitely could have died however. I‚Äôm
still concerned about my lack of hair growth too, like I don‚Äôt even know
what could possibly cause that‚Äîit‚Äôs been that way on my calves for
literally months now. (Since before I ever even started trying to combat
all the emf stuff) Like what would possibly cause my hair to not grow
anymore in certain areas like that?

Latest conversation with Dusty

https://drive.google.com/file/d/12iVLI0D29-ZnEviikAiJthOsn25gUbJo/view?usp=sharing

I have reason to suspect Dusty may be trying to hack my mind. That‚Äôs what
all the EMF stuff is for essentially. They can shift the magnetic polarity
of my brain and cause me to be sedated using all the EMF stuff, then they
can brute force my brain to try and decode its signals using a combination
of one or more microchips and AI. That‚Äôs what happens when you are sedated
is it reverses the magnetic polarity of your brain‚Äìonly through whatever
drug they give you. There has been research done that demonstrates this can
also be done with a strong enough magnet or EMF. I have experienced
sleeping for a lot longer durations of time as of the last few months since
all this started. It seems to change day to day based on my level of EMF
protection on any given night. (I sleep less when I have more protection)

I also have reason to suspect I may have actually been microchipped
previously, likely when getting my second covid shot in May if so. There‚Äôs
records of me having heart aches right after that time‚Äîalthough I couldn‚Äôt
get my Kardia mobile to show my heart beating irregular at the time‚Äîthat‚Äôs
when I bought it actually. I recall the second needle seemed a lot bigger
than the first too, the covid shot needle I mean. (I hate needles) My mom
had gotten the appointments for me when I couldn‚Äôt find any appointments
myself. (Avoid smith's marketplace pharmacy for shots) I now suspect the
microchip could be how they know where I‚Äôm at at all times, how they know
exactly where to point the EMF, etc, etc.

My brother has always been into nanotechnology too which is scary. He also
started trying to tell me how important it is to have rich friends or
whatever before all this began.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubgIsPG6MQ5S1Apkb4MCGLP1pwJhTi2EMG0b6rhEFK0/edit?usp=sharing

I told you they can hack literally anything and everything.

I get it sounds crazy‚Äîbut it‚Äôs all part of the gangstalking playbook. This
is not what I‚Äôm into on my off time. I‚Äôve never been into any of this stuff
before. I‚Äôve never been into nanotechnology.

Plus I‚Äôm only suggesting this now cuz the latest evidence is now suggesting
that to be the case‚Äîhaving already ruled everything else out. I‚Äôve tried
psych meds and they didn‚Äôt change anything in terms of my emf symptoms at
night. (I.e. we ruled it out) I‚Äôm drug tested randomly at my doctors office
and that‚Äôs not it either. Like I‚Äôm trying my hardest to get this all to
stop‚Äîbelieve me‚Äîit‚Äôs completely dehabilitating at times and it is
threatening my whole career. I‚Äôve tried everything. But that‚Äôs the thing,
it has nothing to do with me‚Äîit has everything to do with my brother. So
nothing I can do can get it to stop. At the end of the day all I can do is
base why they are coming after me on my own intuition; and whereas I‚Äôm not
doing anything wrong or illegal myself that I can just stop to get it to
stop that I‚Äôm aware of‚Äîmy intuition therefore tells me my brother is doing
all this for his own selfish reasons. He‚Äôs good at manipulating people to
get what he wants and pretending to be someone he‚Äôs not. What he wants in
this case seems to be to discredit me, to do away with me, and/or to make
me his pawn so that he can get off scott free. Why else would he be doing
all this to me? My brother is just a control freak and he enjoys playing
god in other peoples lives I‚Äôve learned‚Äîparticularly the lives of his
family‚Äîand he got caught. Plus he thinks it‚Äôs funny.

Dusty is like one of those invasive bird species that end up knocking all
the other eggs out of the nest.

https://youtu.be/z5JjTls5kUI


I‚Äôve worked at my job for almost 9 years now‚Äîfull time. And now I‚Äôm being
harassed to the point where it‚Äôs hard to do anything anymore.

You could look at it as oh, his brother is really an angel and it must all
just be him. But that would be dismissing all the bad shit that has
happened to me lately that I have gotten definitive proof of that had
nothing to do with me, it would be dismissing all the oddities like the kid
being sent to my door repeatedly out of nowhere right after that guy was
stalking me and pulled a gun on me/my dog died and always on key dates, the
people breaking in my house who were clearly highly disciplined and who
clearly had tons of intel, etc, etc, it would be dismissing all the hacking
of myself and seemingly everyone around me, it would be dismissing all the
things my brother has done to me and my family over the years and
everything I can tie back to him, it would be dismissing how shady he‚Äôs
been just in general and how he fits the profile of someone who would want
to see my demise, (assuming I‚Äôm right on him doing these same things to our
family which would make sense whereas he‚Äôs now doing these things to me) it
would be dismissing how my brother wouldn‚Äôt even deny being a serial killer
or being in a gang when I asked him directly repeatedly, and at the end of
the day it would be completely contrary to the truth and the overall
patterns and facts over time.

I don‚Äôt think just cuz dusty treated his dog right necessarily means he‚Äôs
not what I‚Äôm accusing him of. I think it‚Äôs more tribal and complex than
that. I have no doubt Dusty treats his new ‚Äúpeople‚Äù right‚Äîincluding their
dogs. But why did he feel the need to get his own ‚Äúpeople‚Äù to begin with?
Why did he begin treating my dog like shit?

It‚Äôs an overall pattern of behavior that is disturbing with my brother‚Äîhe‚Äôs
just gotten good at it over time. And he‚Äôs doing exactly what is necessary
to combat someone who has learned the truth.

Most our siblings agree Dusty doesn‚Äôt have a conscience. I haven‚Äôt heard
anyone say that about me. So then it becomes a question of what are Dusty‚Äôs
capabilities and I‚Äôm telling you right now‚Äîhis capabilities seem to surpass
the capabilities of the police‚Äîat least in terms of hacking, real-time
monitoring, etc, etc.

I know his capabilities first hand and I know how he is both extremely
capable and extremely driven to try and frame me or kill me or discredit
me, based on past experiences. Good luck trying to defend against some
charges for something some hacker did on your devices, or something some
gangstalking group left in your house and then turned you in for‚Äîit would
be almost impossible to defend.

It‚Äôs just saddening to me that there‚Äôs the path I took in life, and now the
path my brother has seemingly taken in life‚Äîand who has the advantage at
this time? That‚Äôs right‚Äîthe person who took the shady path in life has the
advantage. I can‚Äôt hack him and try and frame him or corrupt the people
around him or set him up to get microchipped‚Äîso I‚Äôm left to my own
devices‚Äîand shutting off my devices to try and protect against what I know
my brother is capable of at this time. (Which then makes me look shady, but
tbh it‚Äôs tough shutting off my devices whereas that‚Äôs my whole life before
all this started)

Look at it this way, if you look at mine and Dusty‚Äôs conversations on a
high level starting in 2019. (Hacking and poisoning folder referenced
above) Who is the one trying to convince me to hate my mom? Who is the one
trying to convince me to then hate my siblings, once he started making
leeway with me on my mom? Who is the one making up all these lies about our
family to try and manipulate me into hating my family? Who is the one
telling me I should read books on psychology and then negatively
reinforcing me until I do? Who is the one telling me I should post to
social media more amidst all this? Who is the one who came up with a bogus
reason for me to help him just so he could hack me? Who is the one who
wanted me to quit my job for some odd reason around the same time? Who is
the one who subsequently said he thinks my dog should die? Who is the one
telling me I‚Äôm going to regret not having more people around me‚Äîright after
he was actively trying to get me to distance myself from all the people
around me? Therefore, who is the one who clearly has some endgame in mind?
It‚Äôs not me‚ÄîI just want to live my life. And based on Dusty‚Äôs means of
manipulating me, and his trying to isolate me‚Äîhis end game doesn‚Äôt seem all
that noble. And that‚Äôs all just on a high level, dismissing literally
everything else.

I could care less what Dusty does so long as he‚Äôs not out there hacking,
corrupting, murdering, and framing people‚Äîespecially family. The only thing
I can think of that I‚Äôve encouraged him to do with any real emphasis in the
last few years is for him and his new ‚Äúpeople‚Äù to stop fucking coming after
me‚Äîhe‚Äôs trying to ruin my whole life. And he enjoys it. He enjoys
outsmarting people. (Including and especially the police)

On the other hand, who is the one being completely transparent with
everyone including the police‚Äîthe good, the bad, and the ugly? That one is
me. Cuz I would really like this resolved and soon whereas what my brother
is doing is against the law and he‚Äôs violating my constitutional rights as
a citizen and he‚Äôs been completely fucking up my whole life and the lives
of my loved ones‚Äîand nobody else is willing to stand up to him that I have
found really. Plus, I‚Äôve always been highly transparent just in general,
that‚Äôs just who I am as a person‚Äîeven my brother knows that and he uses it
against me. Again, if I were on drugs I would not have reported all this.
All I know is all this is not going to stop until Dusty gets caught
period‚Äîeven if he gets passed me.

P.s. I plan to goto the doctor to try and either confirm or deny this
latest microchip hypothesis of mine, although it‚Äôs possible we will do an
X-ray and not find anything at first when in reality something could still
be there but the key is I keep learning and ruling things out and following
the evidence and ultimately getting closer to the truth. (I mean it makes
sense there would almost have to be at least one microchip involved given
what they have been doing to me, but we will see..) I might need to get
multiple opinions though. But worst case I figure I‚Äôm only as bad as all
the people who were scared to get covid shots over microchip concerns to
begin with‚Äìonly in my case I now have reason to believe I may have actually
already gotten one. And worst case I learn something which will help me
figure out what to try next. But right now how I feel is I should have
given these claims about microchips being a possible outcome of getting a
covid shot more credibility to begin with myself..

My overall plan:

(I actually got turbos DNA sequenced so I can clone him later on in life,
once I make it through all this‚ÄîI do miss turbo a lot‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt want to
bring any living being into this hell I‚Äôve been being forced to live
lately. I didn‚Äôt even do anything to my brother either yet he like always
has to show me it‚Äôs him who‚Äôs responsible for these people coming after me
but in ways that aren‚Äôt necessarily prosecutable‚Äîlike he did again the
other day‚Äîhe essentially flaunts how smart he is right in front of
everyone. But I don‚Äôt get what axe he has to grind with me‚Äîhe‚Äôs like super
aggressive for no reason the last few years especially to his family. I
don‚Äôt know who he‚Äôs trying to show off for..)

As of December 27, 2021

They are blasting me with radiation nightly‚Äîlike that one isn‚Äôt even
questionable anymore. What are you going to do when I get cancer or
something bad happens to me? Just say oh well and go on with your daily
lives? Like I don‚Äôt get why more people aren‚Äôt completely outraged by all
this. I get it‚Äôs scary and hard to prove but still‚ÄîI also get the sense
most people do believe me to a certain degree.

Tbh if I had to guess the name of my brothers gang off the top of my head,
I‚Äôd guess MS13. I‚Äôd guess my brother after he got fired from his job as a
civil engineer got pulled into a gang by Tom Finn while my brother was
down, and maybe dusty shared some of his shady past in regards to our
family with Tom at the time, and it was like a match made in heaven, or
hell I should say. And now you‚Äôve got a genius expert hacker practically
running MS13 and calling the shots daily. (I mean it would make sense, if
my brother is in a gang he‚Äôs likely a killer, who‚Äôs to say he wasn‚Äôt
already a killer? You guys should have seen the way dusty started talking
previously when he was disparaging our whole family‚ÄîI‚Äôll have to share all
my gang references soon..)

An alternate hypothesis of mine is dusty knew I knew the truth so after he
initially hacked me‚Äîhe went seeking help from someone that he could
convince to actually help him against me. And that someone could have even
been Russia. (I had looked into their social media troll farms in regards
to our elections previously) But that doesn‚Äôt account for him talking like
he were in a gang, posting shit about Ogden gangster, Tom Finn, etc, etc,
all around that same time.

Or maybe he just found some fellow crooked dark web people and told them
straight lies about me, (like the lies he made up when disparaging our
whole family previously) or a combination of all three. I‚Äôm still trying to
figure out exactly who he is affiliated with these days that‚Äôs the thing.
Nobody knows it seems.

The infrasound is coming from the neighbors btw‚ÄîI know cuz whenever I hear
a car drive by it stops for about thirty seconds‚Äîonly to continue on after
the car has driven by. (At least last night it did) Lead is the only thing
I‚Äôve found that stops it from messing with my heart like I shared
previously‚Äîand only when I‚Äôm completely surrounded 360 degrees by it. (Like
no gaps whatsoever can be present) I know this cuz I can still hear the
infrasound/subwoofer through my protection.

As for the microchips, I don‚Äôt f-ing know, I was just saying like these
guys have no limits they won‚Äôt cross and I had symptoms suggesting that and
it makes sense with all their other hacking and with my brothers passion
for nanotechnology since he was a kid. And it sounded like a tracker in my
ear particularly when driving a rental car this last week‚Äîwhich I‚Äôve paid
more attention to since; plus, they likely wouldn‚Äôt have had any other
tracking mechanism in place at the time so I‚Äôm now extremely concerned
about a microchip in particular especially if I‚Äôm going to try to leave. In
addition to all the other reasons I listed above for why I now suspect a
microchip. I had the same eye symptoms again last night btw‚ÄîI had
accidentally disturbed my protection while sleeping and they got through. I
have an appointment with the doctor tomorrow. I really do sense they are
beginning to uncrack my mind tho‚Äîlike just warning everyone‚Äîwhich is why I
have a newfound sense of urgency. I could be wrong on the microchip one, I
guess we will see, but if so it still doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm wrong on everything
else.

Gangs will go to great lengths to track people‚ÄîI just never knew they would
do it to non members. (Anyone who is a perceived threat I guess‚Äîit‚Äôs all in
my references‚Äîlook it up‚Äîdusty asked me to come work with him and I
denied‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt even know he was in a gang at the time) Again, even how
he tried to introduce me to the gang he used plausible deniability, by
talking like a gangster at the time, distancing himself from everyone at
the time, not denying it when I asked‚Äîbut never saying it directly.

I‚Äôm just trying to help ensure Logan doesn‚Äôt become a place rampant with
gangs and corruption and people who are made into zombies to do evil
peoples bidding essentially, and I‚Äôm trying to seek justice for my family
and to help save other peoples lives from what I now know first hand dusty
and his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are capable of. I sometimes wish more people would help. I
feel it could all come to an end sooner if so.

Dusty is smart but he‚Äôs always lacked common sense and he‚Äôs always been
over confident in how smart he is. Like it‚Äôs stupid for him to have even
devoted all his new gang‚Äôs resources towards coming after me to begin with,
whomever his gang may be. I was no threat to them at the time. Like what
the hell did he think was going to happen? If anything he‚Äôs helping ensure
the gang‚Äôs demise by going after someone who knows him so well‚Äîsomeone who
also happens to be a senior software engineer himself which seems to be my
brothers gang‚Äôs core competency. Yea I don‚Äôt specialize in security but my
brother has kinda made me almost have to specialize in security lately.

Dusty has let me know it‚Äôs him so many different times it‚Äôs not even funny.
They all like letting you know who is responsible‚Äîthey just do it in ways
that would be hard to prosecute without showing all the patterns over time.
Some of which are more easily recognizable than others.

At least in my mind, I‚Äôm about as good a witness as you could possibly hope
for in trying to go after a gang kingpin who specializes in technology who
is clearly a threat to society‚Äîlet alone this particular gang kingpin. I
therefore feel it would be wise for you and Logan in general to try and
help keep me alive and free from constant harassment.

Like we live in the United States of America for hell sakes‚Äînot Mexico‚Äînot
Cuba. This shit shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated here. If this continues‚Äîall of Logan
could become corrupted. And I always thought Logan was one of the better
places in the whole country in terms of crime fighting, corruption, etc.
We‚Äôve just got to adapt and overcome to the newly emerging threats of
tomorrow is how I see it.

I really wish Logan had a gang squad right about now tbh‚Äîagain another
vulnerability they are seemingly exploiting.

Yea they do things to try and make me look crazy but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been
going to see doctors, counselors, etc, to try and help counteract all that.
If you‚Äôd like to see me do anything further just let me know. Just realize
it‚Äôs common for anybody's hypothesis to change over time as more
information comes in‚Äîat least the non corrupt/non biased/non ignorant
people‚Äîplus, I try and base everything off of physical evidence‚Äîeven if
it‚Äôs just like an emf reader, etc. At least it‚Äôs something‚Äîif you‚Äôve got
any better ideas on how I can get evidence on emf or infrasound then please
let me know. I therefore really feel it‚Äôs about time more people besides me
begin to stand up to my brother. He can‚Äôt go after all of us after all.
Being silent in a way is contributing to the violence. Plus, I‚Äôve gotten so
much evidence on him by now, it‚Äôs just a matter of presenting it right.
(And adding references which I‚Äôm working on)

I think the best way to go after them might be to do to my brother what he
does to me in terms of creating conflicts of interest with everyone I
affiliate with‚Äîonly do that to dusty using ethical means. (I.e. threaten my
brothers suspected helpers with something else that will make them flip,
like their kids for instance)

Anyways, if you guys ever charge my brother with any crimes, I‚Äôd really
like to know about it so I can make decisions accordingly. Like even just
knowing exactly what gang he is affiliated with could help me exponentially
in terms of my ability to get away from them.

Please don‚Äôt make me regret not joining him.

P.s. Today I created a GRAMA request or freedom of information act request
requesting the utility usages of nearby houses in our neighborhood. Whether
they‚Äôll approve my request or not, I guess we will see. But I would like to
take a look at a few houses electrical bills lately and how they‚Äôve changed
compared to previous years around this same time. (Previous years when I
wasn‚Äôt being emf-d/infrasounded by whom I suspect to be some of our
neighbors) Of course there also can be legitimate reasons for utility bills
to fluctuate some but the more info the better in my mind.

P.s. I still haven‚Äôt gotten my onstar Lexus tracking mechanism/app working
yet btw. I got close after going to the dealership and trying again but
then the email with the new pin code they sent me to activate it never came
through I suspect because the hackers play middleman with my emails. I
still need to try again one more time. But if I‚Äôm right on the microchips,
then they wouldn‚Äôt even need to track my Lexus.

Went to doctor, they cannot detect nanometers on any xray or ct-scan or
ultrasound really is what I got out of it at least‚Äìonly millimeters.
Whereas I believe any microchip to be nanotechnology, seems how I suspect
it would have had to have likely gone through my veins as part of my second
covid vaccine shot, and seems how my brother has always been into
nanotechnology himself, the doctor gave me a referral to go to ear doctor
next and try that‚Äìwhom should have better magnification to try and look for
something like that inside my ear.

As of December 29, 2021

So I‚Äôve been thinking, all this stuff that has been happening to me, all
this hacking and whatnot, you would think it would almost have to be
something like a hostile foreign government or specialized organization for
hire who is behind the bulk of all this given all their capabilities. (Some
core entity who also seems to hire other people‚Äîmaking it harder to track)
Maybe my brother hired Russia or something on the dark web to do his
bidding for him right after he hacked me initially?

I recall telling my manager around 2019 that it had appeared as though
Dusty had hacked me then it appeared as though he had subsequently sold my
information on the dark web because I had a case of credit card fraud and I
got a notice that some of my information was being sold online shortly
after Dusty originally hacked me. (I assume Dusty would have done that to
make it harder to ultimately trace the original hacking back to him)

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DgyeMvcIGa7UxhxbFBPdIVKb6o-iWKzl&disco=AAAATlSBv1g


But even still today there‚Äôs so many different ties back to my brother
Dusty to where that‚Äôs almost the only thing that would seemingly fit the
bill, from what I gather at this time anyways, is a hostile foreign
government or highly capable specialized organization hired by Dusty. I
have gotten the sense when something key happens or I tried talking back to
the hackers through my notes previously that their official response is
delayed, as if they have to relay the info back to someone else before
deciding what to do. Dusty himself recently said buying exploits on the
dark web is a good way to get hacked, maybe he‚Äôs right, but what about
buying a hacker/hitman/gangstalking organization or foreign government to
do all the hacking and whatnot for you on the dark web? That would make
sense why they are so brazen and why they won‚Äôt stop for anything too.

Idk, I‚Äôm still trying to figure it all out. All I know is they seem to show
signs of my brother ultimately being behind all this again and again but
then again they seem to have capabilities that only a hostile foreign
government or else some entity that specializes in only this for a living
would realistically have. (But then again what entity would have that much
resources and this much capability if not a foreign country? I guess I
haven‚Äôt moved yet so we will find out just how many resources they really
have)

They are so sophisticated in how they seemingly don‚Äôt constrain themselves
to just one social group either. Like they seem to span different social
groups either via taking advantage of rumors or via hiring different hitmen
or else they really do have like undercover people who live double lives or
who do only this for a living, deliberately across different social
sterotypes. (Which again makes it hard to track)

I just want to point out that at Rent Dynamics we hired Russian contractors
for some of our development needs previously, that could theoretically play
a factor in all this if it is Russia as well; however, it‚Äôs hard for me to
believe DSR, the Russian company we hired, is now doing all this to me. It
would have had no real reason to tmk, I was nice to DSR, but I did express
concerns about hiring the Russian contracting company in the first place
given what I had learned when working at Utah State University as an intern
including how Russia and China would constantly try and hack anything and
everything at the university. However since then I‚Äôve totally calmed down
on everything Russia and I even had one of the DSR people on my team.

But whichever foreign power/specialized organization/gang/organized crime
organization this is‚Äìand however they came across me/wanting to attack
me‚ÄìI really don‚Äôt think they are just trying to frame my brother Dusty.
Because Dusty seems to play right into everything that‚Äôs been going on with
me lately himself‚Äìto say the least. Like it seems like it‚Äôs a partnership
more than an attempted framing of Dusty.

I guess Dusty could be in on it from day to day, running operations, but
you would think someone would know about that if that‚Äôs really all he‚Äôs
doing at his recording studio. I guess he could just hire a bunch of
different people off the dark web and do his music stuff; but then who is
coordinating it all? That would have to be all dusty does if he really does
coordinate it all from day to day, and it would have to be a decent chunk
of all he‚Äôs ever done to build up that much capability over his lifetime.
If Dusty really is coordinating it all on a day to day basis, why hasn‚Äôt he
been caught yet? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. That‚Äôs why I think it might be a
hired specialized entity or country, with just mere occasional input from
dusty. But then again this did all start for me at least when Dusty opened
up his recording studio and distanced himself from everybody in 2019.

Anyways, what I‚Äôm experiencing now is what one might expect to experience
if a hostile foreign government or some highly capable entity were
realistically trying to hack a person‚Äôs mind through one or more microchips
using AI to encode/decode the mind in various stages, and to map it all out.

First I suspect they brute forced my brain by emf/ef/rf-ing me, in part I
suspect to try and make sense of all the different electrical signals
within my brain/nervous system on a high level, that initial brute forcing
lasted a period of 2-3 months. I suspect it took that long because I
suspect there were some variances in their AI due to any variances with my
prescriptions from day to day. Next they started tapping into my eyes
somehow, making my eyes either go completely black when they were wide
open, or else making them begin to just show signs of something going on
between the feed of my eyes to my brain at nighttimes while they were
EMFing me and still getting through, it‚Äôs honestly hard to explain, but
that lasted for a period of 2 nights thus far. Since then they seem to have
been targeting me while I‚Äôve been awake now, in particular, they keep
targeting me when I‚Äôm standing up peeing now, as if to try and get a
signature on whatever happens in your brain when you stand up and pee. (You
can feel it when they are targeting you, they use infrasound and EMF, both
of which you can actually feel and they always target my head) They seem to
be like trying to stop me from peeing to be even more precise.

I can try and delay their overall process of hacking my mind by turning off
literally all of my electrical breakers anytime I have to pee which makes
it so I can pee in peace‚Äìat this time at least‚Äìbut I assume this process
will continue on in stages until they are ultimately able to fully map out
my whole brain using AI. I just don‚Äôt know what all stages are left or what
awaits me when they get there. However the thing is‚ÄìI really don‚Äôt want to
stick around to find out.

My gut tells me there is definitely a microchip involved here‚Äìat least one.
I get the sense that the microchip is likely powered by my nervous system
and not reliant on a battery or electrical field, but I‚Äôm still narrowing
that down. I‚Äôve also tied some of the noise the suspected microchip makes
to whenever I begin to move around or exert myself physically then it will
make some noise, I discovered that just yesterday. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs
tunable and could be dependent on the surrounding environment. The
suspected microchip also seems to be able to make noise when I was just
driving down the freeway in my loaner car previously, which is when I
initially started to suspect a microchip because it started beeping so
freaking much at the time, meaning it also seems to have remote tracking
capabilities. One thing I might do is try to tap into it myself using RF/HF
signals, via something like the following, or at least listen to the
signals being sent in/out using something like the following myself:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H3T2U7G/ref=crt\_ewc\_title\_dp\_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1‚à£=A2JO7YP9I9Y3D6

https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/a/183591

But I think my best bet for right now is honestly to trust my instincts and
run. Nothing else I‚Äôve done has worked more than just slowing these guys
down at best thus far. Maybe I should stop trying to get evidence on
them/stop trying to slow them down and start trying to save myself. I‚Äôll be
able to find out more key info about this mysterious entity anyways at the
end of the day if I run as well.

I‚Äôd like to get away from my brother Dusty anyways‚Äìhe‚Äôs scary. Like he
doesn‚Äôt seem to have a conscience. So he does fucked up stuff to people for
fun. He might have schizophrenia cuz he mainly seems to target his family
that I‚Äôm aware of‚Äîeven if it is only through hired guns‚Äîthat only makes him
even scarier.

Regardless, the only questions that remain is when to leave, how I‚Äôm going
to fund it, when my passport is going to show up in the mail, what I‚Äôm
going to do with my house and all my current responsibilities, where I plan
to initially run to, how I‚Äôm going to get there, where I‚Äôm going to reside
when I get there, and then what I‚Äôm going to do once I‚Äôm there.

As of December 30, 2021Part 1

What these people are doing with the feed from my brain to my eyes might
actually be caused by another variation of infrasound based on me
experiencing it last night while hearing the sound/feeling the
vibrations‚Äìwhich would be a relief if so‚ÄîI don‚Äôt like the idea of my brain
being tampered with through a microchip after all. But yea, it could just
be infrasound at a different frequency/rhythm than the one that messed with
my heart previously. Infrasound is how your body controls your organs. So
infrasound in the environment could theoretically produce the results I was
describing with my eyes. I now suspect they essentially could be just
sending out their own infrasound using a combination of my house's
electricity, my house's duct work, whatever they installed in my house
previously, and when I shut off all my power, some external infrasound
source that isn‚Äôt quite as powerful‚Äìto give me that effect in my eyes. (It
happened again last night, last night it was pretty loud too before I shut
off all the power to my house‚Äîit was seemingly shaking my whole
room/shelter just depending on where they were seemingly pointing it at the
time)

I also have suspected for some time that they are capable of using sound to
act as sonar or radar, by triangulating their infrasound or something,
allowing them to map out any surrounding area in real time. (Hence why it
seems to me to be like some foreign government or something cuz who even
has that capability? That would be worth some money is all I‚Äôm saying) I
suspect there‚Äôs still something in my ear though that beeps regardless of
where I‚Äôm located, but it varies. Therefore I now suspect that thing in my
ear to be primarily a tracker microchip.

Most all the references I‚Äôve been referring to throughout this entire
document should now be present somewhere in this google drive folder just
fyi. Some of the references were deleted, likely forever. Others might
could be dug up if I had a clean computer and enough time to devote to it.
I dunno if any of the references in any of these folders have been tampered
with or not, I‚Äôm scared to log in to some of my other accounts that are the
actual owners/editors of some of these google drive files/folders, the
folders linked to from within this folder, for any substantial amount of
time to add any more comments and to lay everything out in an intuitive way
that I could then add as clear references within this document for that
exact reason‚Äìto try and avoid anybody tampering with what I do already have
here. (That‚Äôs how I get around all the hacking at this time is simply by
never logging into certain key accounts lol and then referencing certain
google drive folders from my other google drive accounts like this one, and
by using physical security keys or yubikeys on all my accounts as 2fa, to
prevent them from being able to login to those accounts directly without me
doing it myself, etc)

I hope I‚Äôve given you enough, I‚Äôve honestly given it my all for some time
now‚Äìif you need something in particular just ask‚Äìbut I think it‚Äôs about
time for me to try and make finding a better life elsewhere my main
priority. (You know, a life where I don‚Äôt have to worry about my life every
single day, a life where I don‚Äôt have to focus on all this bad shit that
happened in the past daily, and a life where I don‚Äôt have to sleep in a
faraday cage nightly, etc, etc)

It‚Äôs about to be a new year now, I‚Äôm hoping I can put all this behind me
and live a happier, more fulfilling life with less worries and less bad
shit happening to me this next year. ü§û That‚Äôs my new years resolution
anyways. I‚Äôll try and keep adding references going forward but it might be
a while cuz I don‚Äôt want to have to continue to devote all my time to it,
I‚Äôve spent like the last 2-3 weeks primarily trying to get all my data in a
place to where I could actually reference any key parts of it that aren‚Äôt
already present here. (All my free time pretty much) And I haven‚Äôt even
gone through and indexed it all yet to pull out any key parts that aren‚Äôt
already here, let alone uploaded it all to this folder and subsequently
referenced it all within this document accordingly. (I‚Äôm referring to all
my raw phone/computer backups, slack comments which I don‚Äôt even have
access to right now, old emails from other accounts, just everything that
wasn‚Äôt already in this google drive folder‚Äìso it‚Äôs just been super time
consuming and difficult to do is all‚Äìbut I did make good progress getting
it all to where I can now index it better, etc) Plus I feel it‚Äôs in my best
interest to move away to try and save myself while I still can, as stated
above. I feel I‚Äôve already endured all this torture way longer than most
people would to try and help with justice. But if you need something in
particular just let me know. Text me on my google voice number, that one
seems to normally always work without interference/tampering for the most
part I think. (435) 261-2308 And that way it will make it a little easier
on me to get you only more specific things. Because getting all my stuff
off old hard drives has been taking literally forever. (Well not literally
but you get what I‚Äôm saying)

I still plan to go back through and add some of the references to the
things already located in this google drive folder probably tomorrow, so it
doesn‚Äôt bleed into the new year, just to make it a little easier on you and
because I said I would, but please recognize everything I have already done
thus far‚Äìit hasn‚Äôt been easy. This is beginning to look like a freaking
book now. Regardless, sorry for the delay.

I will likely still keep updating this as well with anything that happens
from here on out but hopefully not as frequently as I have been, I start
work again on Monday after all.. And I‚Äôm hoping it will stop or slow down
at least once I move, I may end up moving at any time too, once I figure
out where I‚Äôm going, etc.

Regardless, thank you for reading. Thank you for your help as well, it‚Äôs
been a little better lately, at least in terms of them not stealing my
keys, not constantly breaking into my house, etc, etc. Happy new year!

Part 2

I‚Äôm not giving up btw. The hackers made a huge mistake in admitting to
killing my dog the other day‚Äîregardless of whether they did or not. My dog
was a local celebrity. Shit like cemetery sound clips don‚Äôt just play on my
computer out of nowhere like that. What I suspect they were trying to do is
make any memory of my dog be a bad one‚Äîbut that was a bad move‚Äîand I simply
refuse to let that happen. (It‚Äôs more Charles Manson psychology tactics I
suspect, I swear to god dusty is more Charles Manson than Charles Manson
himself)

Regardless, Dusty needs some serious help. I hope you all will join me in
helping to ensure dusty is brought to justice, if not for me, if not for
karie or my father‚Äîbut for turbo. Dusty/the hacker(s) have admitted to
killing all of them in similar ways previously. What Dusty does to all
these people/animals makes him deserving of being locked up for the rest of
his life in my opinion‚Äîeasily‚Äîregardless of how smart he is. I‚Äôm happy to
do whatever is necessary to bring down such a horrific person who happens
to be my brother. He tries making my life and turbo's life and the lives of
my loved ones miserable for no reason other than for his own personal
enjoyment. I said my kryptonite is my love for my brother‚Äîand it is‚Äîbut
dusty can fuck off as far as I‚Äôm concerned at this stage.

Dusty for some reason seems to only get enjoyment out of hurting and
controlling others these days which is not okay. In a way, this is like an
epic battle between two brothers both for their lives‚Äîgood vs evil. I‚Äôm
okay with that tho cuz at least if I die I‚Äôll be dying for a noble
cause‚Äîalthough I wish it didn‚Äôt have to be this way. By Dusty‚Äôs life I mean
life in prison btw. But yea, dusty leaves me very little choice but to try
and get him locked up. I therefore could honestly use all the help I can
get because I‚Äôm completely outnumbered here and I didn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôd one
day be forced to play this fucked up game of my brothers just to stay alive
and avenge my loved ones until I was literally smack in the middle of it.

Dusty didn‚Äôt like me writing that last part apparently, he‚Äôs now trying to
control me through his microchip‚Ä¶ Time to put my ear plugs back in‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll say it again‚Äìworst brother ever. Name one person who would be a worse
brother than this for me to have given my intelligence and my ability to
see through their shit. One person. I‚Äôd honestly recommend my whole family
get the fuck away from Dusty at this stage‚Äìat least until he‚Äôs caught‚Äìand
stay away from shots especially if you have any suspicions you might be
hacked and/or are single..

I now suspect Dusty can screw with me both through infrasound and the
mircochip btw. I suspect Dusty‚Äôs Ogden Recording Company LLC and/or ELIXEY,
LLC could really just be a weapons testing facility, at least in part.
(infrasound)

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zdqa\_VIphs-zzLY19\_MhPtxCfHxtjN4p?usp=sharing

I do suspect Dusty may have tampered with some of my evidence already btw.
I saw some of the files get reloaded in the background multiple times last
time I logged into the account that owns that main hacking\_poisoning notes
folder when I was merely just reading through and commenting on some of the
files to link to as references later.. (And files only reload like that
when a new file is uploaded, plus that account I purposely never log into
for that exact reason‚Äìto avoid tampering) No hacker would tamper with that
folder unless my brother is truly the one behind everything‚Äîcuz that folder
outlines a ton of stuff to do with my conversations about my brother. I‚Äôve
caught him in situations like this more than once too. Like him deleting
all his messages off my phone previously. Like what hacker who wanted to
frame him would keep doing that?

Now it‚Äôs not just hacking and assault and poisoning and emf-ing and
infrasound and attempted explosions and attempted gassings I have to worry
about with my brother Dusty‚Äìhe can now legit start f-ing with my brain‚Äôs
signals through a nanotechnology microchip he somehow had put into I
suspect my vaccine to try and negatively reinforce whatever I‚Äôm doing
and/or ultimately likely take control of my mind.. (He‚Äôs the new Charles
Manson)

If he really loved me I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be doing all of this to me. My
only thing is it‚Äôs hard for me to stop loving my family‚Äìregardless of what
they put me through. I love my brother so freaking much. But I really do
think Dusty needs some serious help. He legit enjoys hurting others.

Dusty didn‚Äôt even show up to the appointment I made for him and I to go see
a psychologist together previously. (Even though he originally indicated he
would)

Dusty never stops‚Äìhe will never stop unless he‚Äôs completely forced to‚Äìhe‚Äôs
shown me that time and time again.

My hope is Dusty gets charged with something that will just cause him to
wake the hell up and stop hurting people. Losing him for the rest of my
life would be really really tough tbh. But then again I'll likely always
fear the day he gets out for anything less than that. These are all my
honest/genuine emotions.

I have little doubt he‚Äôs going to end up sending at least one person to
follow me wherever I end up moving to btw, likely multiple..

I have a hypothesis on Dusty‚Äôs motive. He legit thinks our dads money is
‚Äúhis‚Äù money as he said‚Äîyou know, cuz dusty I think killed our dad. So Dusty
doesn‚Äôt want anybody to be able to enjoy ‚Äúhis‚Äù money that Dusty doesn‚Äôt
approve‚Äîeven if that means killing them or in my case trying to do mind
control on me and completely take over my mind before I ever get to truly
enjoy my inheritance or else just to frame me if he ever truly can control
my mind. (Whereas I‚Äôm a particular inconvenience to him because I caught
him in the act, so if he straight killed me he knows the police would be
all over him) The timing for dusty to turn on me was pretty precarious too.
Right when I bought one of my dads commercial buildings from Taylor. It‚Äôs
as if dusty does whatever Cindy wants or something. (When in reality‚ÄîI even
told Taylor like let me know if you ever change your mind and we can work
some partnership out or something) But the only person Dusty seemingly
approves of having ‚Äúhis‚Äù money is Cindy and Cindy‚Äôs daughter Taylor. Either
that or dusty just doesn‚Äôt like any of us continuing our fathers legacy
period. What‚Äôs a bigger slap in the face to my father than creating a 3d
land survey of death using infrasound anyways? Dusty always hated our
father for ‚Äúmaking‚Äù him follow in his footsteps as a land surveyor and
civil engineer. And so what does he do? He seemingly creates or somehow
buys this like triangulating infrasound sonar I described above, only using
sound which dusty has always been into, which essentially allows dusty to
map out any building in real time to find his victims. Like that‚Äôs as big a
slap in the face to any parent I could ever possibly even think of. (Well
besides killing them) Then he uses it to go after all my dads children
besides the one who was birthed by Cindy. Now that is some hate right
there. That is extreme hatred. Like Cindy seemingly somehow completely
fucked my brother up. I feel bad for him but I don‚Äôt.

Dusty has always been very childish/rebellious at heart. It‚Äôs like he never
fully matured. Just being honest. He never lets anything go either. He‚Äôs
very cold and calloused, these days anyways. He thinks he gets whatever he
wants. There are no if ands or buts about it. And he‚Äôll do some extremely
shady things to make that happen. All he cares about is himself, he thinks
he‚Äôs a gangster. As much as I hate to say this‚ÄîDusty really needs to be in
jail tbh. Like straight up.

Dusty clearly now thinks of me as less than human. And him thinking of me
that way seemingly happened in like a flip of a switch it seems. I just
wish I knew how to flip that switch back the other way or something. I
really wouldn‚Äôt be doing all this unless I truly genuinely felt that this
isn‚Äôt going to end well unless something is done and soon. Like dusty will
not stop with just me. He simply has too many capabilities and therefore he
won‚Äôt stop until he‚Äôs given a reason to.

One last thing I just wanted to say, if dusty ever succeeds in killing me,
just keep in mind that dusty has such extreme capabilities that the first
person who will know if I die is dusty and they have gotten in my house so
many freakin times to where if I‚Äôm ever reported as dead‚Äîbe extremely
skeptical of the scene is all I‚Äôm saying. And I want a freakin thorough
autopsy done by someone he can‚Äôt corrupt. He has freaking 3d x-ray/survey
capabilities after all and the ability to emf or probe me for a response,
and they monitor me daily, so dusty would know before anyone else if he
ever succeeds in actually killing me and he‚Äôd therefore have a chance to do
what he loves to do the most which is to try and stage/frame my death as
being from something it‚Äôs not.. (Take/destroy any evidence inconvenient to
him, plant things, etc, etc, all in time for him to act like he is actually
shocked of my passing, and act like he actually cares about me) Just wanted
to throw that out there‚ÄîI‚Äôm not even joking or exaggerating‚Äîthey infrasound
me daily and they‚Äôve tried staging my death numerous times already..

If I were you‚ÄîI‚Äôd actually try real hard to do something about my brother
before that actually happens. Because my brother could theoretically
completely fuck up this entire case that way. And then you‚Äôll have a serial
killer still on the loose for likely years to come.

Another mysterious strange clear somewhat thick substance on my hallway
floor this evening I found after I got home that wasn‚Äôt from anything I
recall doing.. (And I live alone) I don‚Äôt recall it being there when I left
either. Dusty was mad at me too for adding more detailed stuff to this doc
and for saying I‚Äôd still add references. Like I‚Äôm not messing around you
guys‚Äîthis is a highly capable organized crime group of some form or
another. Please don‚Äôt make all my hard work be in vain. If there was ever a
credible microchip/emf/infrasound/gangstalking back story then mine has got
to be among the top of that list‚Äîregardless of how outlandish it may
sometimes sound. Bottom line is everything they are doing to me is
literally engineered to seem outlandish for a reason. They‚Äôve tried to kill
me so many times now. I suspect they have killed other people already. I
just want the police to actually arrest my brother already. It‚Äôs completely
obvious that he‚Äôs involved at the very least or else he is completely
overseeing the entire operation at most. Don‚Äôt miss out on this
opportunity. If I were you I‚Äôd get my brother while he‚Äôs still around. Cuz
otherwise you‚Äôll never be able to bring him to justice and he‚Äôll be able to
continue his reign of terror against everyone around here remotely‚Äîwhich
would be a nightmare tbh. He‚Äôs not dumb‚Äîkeep that in mind please.

They definitely were in my house again. They installed something which
makes any electrical breaker of mine that is powered on begin to emit
neutron or gama rays on their command. I know it‚Äôs neutron or gama rays cuz
it goes right through my enclosure even from the other side of my house‚Äîand
my enclosure is made up of a faraday cage on the outside plus a full led
interior‚Äîplus like inches and inches of foam sound proofing. I turned off
all my breakers one by one and it got better and better each breaker I
turned off until there was only one neutron or gama ray emitter left that
was still giving me infrasound heart type symptoms‚Äîbut all my breakers were
off at that point. So I turned off my power outside and even still there
was one neutron or gama ray emitter left. I think they may be illegally
tying into power, and illegally making it so my house still gets some power
when the meter outside is completely shut off‚Äîbecause they clearly still
have power to whatever they have in my attic even though everything is
completely shut off. The meter outside seems about where the last one is
coming from btw, I know cuz I put up some water in its direct line of sight
to my bed to try and get some sleep last night. I am 100 percent confident
these guys are messing with my power though and Rocky Mountain power and
the authorities should really get involved and get to the bottom of it
because these neutron or gama ray emitters are extremely dangerous and
seemingly indiscriminate in where they are being pointed‚Äîbut again they are
controlled remotely like everything else these guys do‚Äîand therefore they
can be powered off remotely. But yea, in order to block neutron or gama
rays you‚Äôd need either inches and inches of led or else inches and inches
of concrete or water.

Or you could just arrest my brother and bring this all to an end just like
that.

Like I told you these guys always evolve to try and keep up the pressure.
But the thing is‚Äîthe authorities should evolve and turn up the pressure
right back at them in my opinion. Adding neutron or gama ray emitters like
that to a home CANNOT possibly be legal. I suspect they have some hidden
primary raspberry pi or similar device somewhere hidden down the pipe of
the Rocky Mountain side of my electrical meter or else somewhere in my
electrical meter itself as well which serves as the base hub for all their
hacking and electrical tampering for my whole house‚Äîbut you‚Äôd have to do an
actual thorough inspection with someone who has an idea what they are
looking for.

I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again it‚Äôs insane how much these guys
are allowed to get away with. It‚Äôs also insane just how brazen they are and
continue to be. At this rate it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôll have to just disappear
and not use any of my accounts and not be in contact with anybody plus get
this microchip removed and live off grid just to have any chance at getting
away from all this nonsense and even then these guys will still be out
there killing people and tampering with people's electricity
indiscriminately all for their own pleasure.

You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Plus it fits an overall pattern I‚Äôve been
stating now for some time. There‚Äôs no illness out there that constantly
evolves based on what I write in a google drive folder like this. (I just
stated above that I can turn off all my breakers and all the
vibration/infrasound got a lot better, like a lot less intense‚Äîthat‚Äôs
actually the part Dusty/the hacker didn‚Äôt like me writing earlier‚Äîso what‚Äôs
he do? Instructs one of his guys to break into my house again and add
something to make it so its intense as hell regardless of whether all my
power is off or not‚Äîand using the next stage of radiation that can go right
through my shelter. Now my electrical meter is still pulling power even
when it‚Äôs completely shut off outside. These new radiation things they
installed have a completely different sound to them too, they sound like
they are spinning, and they didn‚Äôt vibrate anything like the other one did.
Like they were spinning around indiscriminately shooting out what had to be
neutron or gama rays. I‚Äôve already proven I could block out all my symptoms
with my existing enclosure previously‚Äîbad timing on their part‚Äîcuz I‚Äôve
been sleeping well for arguably weeks now ever since I got the led‚Äîuntil
tonight‚Äîotherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have agreed to go back to work yet) But yea,
it‚Äôs my brother‚Äîlike I‚Äôve been saying now since the very beginning‚Äîhe‚Äôs
been busted numerous times now in numerous different ways‚Äîplus he‚Äôs a
serial killer and a hacker. He wants to discredit me and make my life as
miserable as he can possibly make it and isolate me because I‚Äôm turning him
in for being exactly that‚Äîa serial killer and a hacker. It really is as
simple as that.

Some (but not all) Dusty gangster references:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PGc6ncUsAUuftYDLFpFFT16\_dhREfD8I

As of December 31, 2021

They totally deleted my comments on the video of turbo where I laid out how
they admitted to killing my dog turbo in real-time as their confession
happened. Hopefully someone saw those comments before they were deleted.
I‚Äôll try and add the gist of them back here.

I sent my co-workers a link to my comments on that video of Turbo I think
like two days ago. The now deleted comments on that video of turbo in an
email covered how the hacker(s) totally admitted to killing turbo twice,
and how Dusty had started spreading rumors to my neighbors previously.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QNkLe0ZG9ZEDpLLUiAVLTAKnOvrubhSZ&disco=AAAATmMc\_kU


The hackers first essentially admitted to it by messing with only what I
was typing relating to turbo‚Äôs death and everyone seemingly piling on after
Turbo died including the neighbors. They messed with only that part about
Turbo when I was typing a draft version of that comment the night before.
Once they did that I didn‚Äôt finish the comment that night but I made note
of their #signal they had sent me the next day when drafting the newer
version essentially, and as soon as I did that while still typing in google
drive just like I‚Äôm doing now for the most part‚Äìout of nowhere a sound clip
of like a cemetery sound played on my computer‚Äìwhich I took as a second
signal of the hackers admitting to poisoning turbo. (Because that doesn‚Äôt
just happen for no reason)


Then I went on to say essentially I suspect Dusty tried to frame me to my
neighbors right after I initially called him out for killing our father and
Karie for Cindy‚Äìlike by spreading false rumors to my neighbors around the
same time he was making up all these lies and spreading them about our
whole family. Quick side note, but with that said I really do think that
child abuser guy is legit acting on more than just a rumor, like he‚Äôs in on
it himself directly and he likely know‚Äôs Dusty even if he acts like he
doesn‚Äôt; regardless, i‚Äôm hoping this document will help quite any rumors my
brother has made/continues to make about me going forward.

Furthermore, do you want to know just how evil my brother really is? He‚Äôs
been like really into all this dark psychology shit ever since 2019 pretty
much right? He was dragging our whole family down with all his dark
psychology that whole year when Dusty‚Äôs people first poisoned Turbo.

So guess what they did tonight, on New Years Eve? They started playing
sounds of Turbo from I suspect the time of their second successful
poisoning when they killed him‚Äìwhich subsequently led to turbo getting
kidney failure and tanking quickly. I‚Äôm not going to let it get to me, they
could just be making it up. But I do have the sound clip they played me
earlier of turbo breathing just from doing a voice recorder session when
they were playing it to me on my computer earlier tonight‚Äìthey also
deliberately kept lighting off fireworks outside at the time to make it
sound like turbo was getting shot or something. I ignored them for the most
part but I did start recording‚Äìbecause I don‚Äôt want them to be able to get
to me especially when I‚Äôm doing such important work as going through
everything and trying to reference all my old stuff to hopefully help bring
them to justice.

Anyways, this unnamed satin group led or partially led by my brother Dusty
legit seems to get enjoyment out of causing others pain and suffering,
including animals, as I‚Äôve said. Don‚Äôt let all my brothers dark psychology
get to you or change your perception of turbo in any way either because it
can bring you down if you aren't careful and because I think that‚Äôs exactly
what it is intended to do. Turbo died in my arms at the end of the day
luckily so I still feel at peace.

But yea, the whole reason I‚Äôm bringing this up is because the only possible
place they could have poisoned turbo without my knowledge that led to his
death that I can even think of is at medvet the last time I ever took him
there. (They don‚Äôt let the pet owners inside at medvet due to covid) If
that is correct as I suspect, I bet we could find out exactly which vet
technician handled turbo at medvet that evening is why I‚Äôm saying this. And
it could be an in to their whole poisoning tactics‚Äîwhich would be nice from
the police's perspective in my view seems they seem to do that a lot. And
it would help avenge turbo at the end of the day too.

Please excuse me if I ever decide to go deck my brother in the face myself.
I mean I‚Äôm holding back‚Äîtrust me. But my brother is a wimp without all his
cronies and gadgets, I could totally kick his ass and sometimes he makes me
really want to. But at the end of the day all this is on them and not me‚Äîno
use becoming like them either. I‚Äôm not the one who had to sit there and
poison a small dog like that. That can‚Äôt be an enjoyable memory regardless
of who you are. Turbo was at medvet in the first place for a reason is how
I see it‚Äîlike he hadn‚Äôt been doing all that well as is. Anyways, it is what
it is I guess. I am getting in touch with medvet and I‚Äôll try getting you
guys the name of both the main director there as well as the name of the
suspected vet techs who did it. I guess I‚Äôll post the audio the hackers
shared with me here as well, just so you get a sense of how ruthless my
brother and his people really are, but use it as a motivator to do good and
not as a hindrance on turbos legacy. Some of Dusty‚Äôs darker tendencies seem
to have to do with dark psychology btw‚Äîdon‚Äôt let him get to you. He‚Äôll
hopefully be in jail sooner than later anyways if I can help it.

Tbh, I don‚Äôt know why they would have even poisoned my dog or why they are
coming after me so hard to begin with, like as you‚Äôll see in all these
references as I continue to add them, like the most Dusty could possibly
even be mad at me for is buying my little sisters commercial unit and/or
saying I couldn‚Äôt do his website in the way he wanted it done given my
level of experience in wordpress at the time‚Äìafter he had already hacked me
at that time himself. He seemed to indicate those weren‚Äôt the reasons just
barely‚Äîhe seemed to indicate it was apparently cuz I didn‚Äôt drop everything
and go work with him on his command‚Äîbut I simply don‚Äôt believe him. He was
being shady as hell and I hadn‚Äôt even seen him for forever; plus I didn‚Äôt
know I was under his rule. I didn‚Äôt even know he was even in a gang at the
time either or I would have definitely said no; and he fucking hacked me
before even asking for me to come work with him anyways which just shows
how he‚Äôs totally lying. If anything, if I had actually listened to him;
somehow dropped turbo as he said, (Which I never would and he knows that)
and if I had indeed quit my job and went down there at the drop of a hat
like he had suggested at the time‚Äîagainst all my better judgment‚ÄîI have a
feeling I‚Äôd likely be dead by now. (Isolating me is what they are still
trying to do to me to this very day btw) But yea, that's how these killers
justify coming after me and turbo I guess. (Even tho it doesn‚Äôt make any
fucking sense‚Äîas if any gang around here even only gives people one shot to
join anyways‚Äîyea fucking right) I guess you could also theorize it‚Äôs for me
getting Jacade Rausch locked up‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt make any sense either.
That dude was stalking me to begin with for a reason. In addition‚ÄîI got my
covid shots in may so that also rules that one out in my mind. I‚Äôll keep
you posted on the microchip but all signs are pointing at there is one in
my left ear. It even started heating my finger nail when I was trying to
block out the signal without any proper ear plugs earlier today. I now even
have a sense of exactly where it‚Äôs located even.. (Which is a plus) One
last possibility I can even think of is if Dusty truly did get taken
advantage by Tom Finn when Dusty was down after Dusty lost his job‚Äîassuming
Tom Finn were some high up in the gang then it could I guess be plausible
that when Dusty and Tom came up to my house the last time when they started
acting hostile towards me then I recall Tom Finn disrespected me so I
disrespected him back. (Just by reacting to his hostility in a more or less
hostile manner, telling him if he didn‚Äôt like my microwave then don‚Äôt use
it) But if that were the case why did they try framing me so quickly during
the same trip by putting something in my garage while they were there? So
that one doesn‚Äôt make sense either. That‚Äôs it. Those are all my ideas. Not
even sure how plausible any of those are though. Beyond the one other
suspected reasoning I have which I‚Äôve touched on throughout this document.

I strongly suspect they have been coming after me to silence me as a
witness to what Dusty may have done to my father and sister previously.
That‚Äôs the only thing that truly makes sense. Which is what this whole
document/book essentially concludes.

I think Dusty might now be trying to shield Cindy by coming forward with
more of his gang stuff.

With all that said, I suspect my brother‚Äôs gang legit will even have
members of their gang whose sole objective is just to get hired on to a
given place just to perform a poisoning or I guess a microchipping from
what I gather. Like I think that might be how they got something into my
jamba juice when I woke up feeling like my stomach was going to explode the
other day. (Either that or they were freaking emf-ing /infrasounding my gut
causing issues whereas I had led covering the rest of my upper body at the
time) But I have suspected this with this group regardless. My brother and
his gang are fucking ruthless. If they don‚Äôt get you down physically‚Äìthey
will try and take you down using all their dark psychology. So next time
you start thinking about me potentially having any involvement in anything
to do with my brother and all this gang stuff‚Äìjust remember this is the
level of evil we are really talking about here. And these guys seemingly
actually enjoy it.

Added latest electricity bill. To be clear, it is way higher again however
I‚Äôm not sure how much of it is attributable to the space heater I started
using so I could shut my furnace off at nighttimes to be fair. I think I
started using the space heater around the beginning of December.
Regardless, I highly doubt my space heater takes up double or more of my
usual electricity for my whole house.

Turbo Second Poisoning Admission By Hackers

Added one of the two attempted audio recordings I captured of the hackers
playing a sound clip of turbo suffering‚ÄìI have narrowed it down to have had
to have been originally captured while they were apparently poisoning him
at medvet‚Äîthey played these to me yesterday, on new years eve. I dunno if
my audio clips captured the actual computer‚Äôs audio though, or if they just
captured the microphone audio or what. I think it just captured the
microphone audio. (In which case it will likely be harder to hear the
actual clip they played to me of turbo suffering‚Äìbecause it had to come out
the speakers and go back in the microphone in order for you to be able to
hear it‚Äìand it wasn‚Äôt all that loud to begin with‚Äìjust loud enough for me
to notice essentially)

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-YHqmNZwGSKD9591aZbGKGp0JcEBz4Ly&authuser=chase%40gfic.io&usp=drive\_fs


I have one more audio file I think‚Äìif I can figure out how to get it off my
computer. It‚Äôs the first audio I captured when the fireworks were also
seemingly going off in unison outside my home at the time.

I really think their audio clip had to have been from the last time I ever
took Turbo to medvet. (Which I think would have been either right before or
right after I got Jacade Rausch busted for pulling a gun on me)

I recall Turbo wasn‚Äôt doing all that hot anyways, like I had taken him down
to medvet multiple times over the preceding two weeks I remember. But I
also recall that last time I took him down there‚ÄìI ended up having to rush
and get him‚Äìhe was doing considerably worse than when I dropped him off.
And he died like hours later. And he would have likely died there alone had
I not called them and asked about him myself, which is when they broke the
bad news and is when I rushed down there to pick him up so he could die at
home essentially.

I didn‚Äôt like that doctor that night either‚Äìhe sounded like a lady and he
wasn‚Äôt very helpful. But yea, not sure who did it but I know that doctor
said he had worked there for something like 19 years or something so I‚Äôm
just assuming it had to have been one of the vet techs.

The audio recording they played to me on my computer I think were of turbo
breathing hard at first and then turbo‚Äôs breathing kinda sounding more like
he was suffering towards the end. I think they only played them to me cuz
it was of him suffering, I just didn‚Äôt want to believe it, but I don‚Äôt know
if you can make that out in the clip I captured of them playing it to me.
That‚Äôs also how I know it was at medvet where the poisoning must have
happened. Cuz turbo was always with me unless he was at the vet or grooming
salon essentially and plus that‚Äôs the only time his health tanked between
dropping him off and picking him up anywhere. I‚Äôm still not sure exactly
what they did to him tho tbh, I couldn‚Äôt make that out from their audio.

But at the end of the day multiple vets had recommended I consider
euthanizing turbo by that point anyways, not sure if they poisoned him even
more than the 2 times I now know about or what, but at the end of the day
turbo died in my arms afterwards but only cuz I was vigilant and proactive
that evening. However I never would have known dusty‚Äôs gang were
responsible without the hackers playing those clips to me of him suffering
and the hackers admitting it to me repeatedly essentially. Like I said,
that is their kryptonite. They like receiving credit/acknowledgement for
their work.

I‚Äôll try to get the first audio clip I captured of turbo that the hackers
were playing to me yesterday. I assume they played it to me to try and get
to me and make any memories I have of turbo be bad ones essentially. If I
am able to successfully figure out a way to export the other audio clip
I‚Äôll upload it here as well. That other initial clip was taken on my root
user‚Äôs voice memo app, and I‚Äôve been having a hard time figuring out how to
export it or even re-play that one sadly. At least I switched users and got
one of the audio clips that I can now share with you however..

But I promise you it happened. They killed Turbo after all‚Äìjust like Dusty
ordered. They are ruthless.

As of January 2, 2022
Lightsabers/Triangulating Infrasound/X-ray Vision

Their latest emf sounds like a lightsaber being flung around‚Äìlike straight
up. Like it‚Äôs got to be consuming some serious power because it‚Äôs powerful
as hell even from across my whole house.

I now have to turn off all my power at nighttimes, besides like my fridge
and furnace. I also have to have ~12 to ~14 inches of water plus a faraday
cage plus multiple inches of foam plus 1-2 inches of solid steel all
blocking from the direction of my power meter to my head‚Äìor else blocking
from the direction of any other breaker I leave turned on to my head‚Äìbut
even still‚Äìtheir new weapon thing still is able to get through all that
protection on occasion and go straight through my head and my whole house.
It‚Äôs going from South to North. I bet you could feel it if you stood
outside on the sidewalk or in my yard to the north outside my home in the
mornings towards the north east corner bedroom of my house. (Assuming they
don‚Äôt take what I say and evolve to try and make me look crazy again) And
if you kneeled down. (Because that‚Äôs where my bed is at, they target my
head whenever I‚Äôm laying down/sleeping) I guarantee there is residual
energy going straight through my house despite all my protections in place
whenever they use the lightsaber ones. (Also notice how they installed them
right before I was supposed to return to work)

I think it‚Äôs about time for me to bounce, but if I bounce they‚Äôll likely
just send someone out to uninstall whatever it is on either my meter or my
electrical panel and reinstall it wherever I end up, and likely no evidence
will be obtained, thereby not solving anything.

I think it might have something to do with my power breakers cuz when I
originally had them all turned on the other day, after they broke in again,
afterwards they were seemingly all able to emit these powerful lightsaber
rays from each and every individual breaker in my house. (From a bunch of
different angles/locations, from the locations each breaker covers
essentially) That‚Äôs what I was getting at when I said it got less and less
intense as I shut off my breakers one by one the other day‚Äìit was like
turning off a different lightsaber one by one until all that was left was
one lightsaber coming from the direction of my meter outside. I think they
either installed new power breakers the other day when they were in my
house or else they did something else to make it so they could emit gama
rays from each separate circuit in my house, or else using my main meter or
main power line itself. They now appear to be trying to kill me using my
own power, once again they have evolved to their latest intel and exploited
vulnerabilities in my latest defenses. Prior to their latest new
installation, my protection had me completely covered and from all angles.
Now I will likely never be able to have that much protection from all
possible angles in my house. (I‚Äôll never be able to leave my power on again
if I want to get any sleep whatsoever, and even doing what I‚Äôm doing now I
mean it still gets through on occasion and it‚Äôs not healthy, I suspect they
might just turn the power down during the day times anyways so that I‚Äôm
constantly being exposed to radiation while I‚Äôm here)

I strongly suspect they do something similar with sound as well. They are
able to use sound in a way where they can triangulate the sound to any
location in my house, bounce it off of their other sound waves, and then
cause a fourth sound wave to go in a completely different direction from
that of the original intersected sound waves‚Äô location. So like they can
point three different sound waves to all intersect inside my faraday cage,
and then they can make those three sound waves create a new fourth sound
wave that is then pointed to go in a specific direction towards my head
inside there, bypassing a bunch of my protections; however, the fourth
sound wave essentially originates from inside my faraday cage itself. I
suspect they do this by triangulating the sound. (Having sound bounce off
sound in different ways)

That‚Äôs also how I suspect they do their 3d real time land surveying or
victim monitoring or x-ray vision capabilities, but for that they don‚Äôt
need it to be as powerful. When I get time I want to look this all up on
the dark web to see what all is being sold that fits this description.
Which could help me narrow down exactly how it works and exactly where
their devices are placed to enable this kind of thing.. (And how much it
costs to see how rich my brother really is)

I‚Äôm wondering if they are able to do something similar only with
electricity as well tbh. Like cause my electricity to triangulate and
escape into different directions to form the emfs/lightsabers directed at
my head. It‚Äôs all part of the same electromagnetic spectrum after all. And
I know they‚Äôve messed with my electricity on numerous different occasions.

I bet these tools they are using could even go right through like the
presidential limousine in some places is all i‚Äôm saying. Like there‚Äôs no
stopping these directed energy weapons without like a legit solid
steel/underground bunker.

I recommend anyone at risk like me to put a lock on your electrical
meters/put non hackable cameras facing your electrical meters nowadays.
These guys can seemingly also tie in through your a/c power outside, I know
my a/c power line has shown signs of being tampered with previously. And I
recommend people get hardened locks on your doors so they can‚Äôt just
break-in and bypass everything. (bump proof/pick proof locks‚Äìmedeco is
supposedly the best given their key control patents and their complex key
designs)

Just think how useful this technology would be for the police! (Just sayin)
It could be used to save lives instead of to end them. Like the police
could even use it while executing a search warrant or something‚Äìto locate
and monitor everyone inside. (My brother‚Äôs technology seems to be able to
be outfitted from either tapping into my own electricity directly or else
from triangulating three cars outside the premises‚Äìmeaning you wouldn‚Äôt
even need to tap into their electricity to make use of it) You could then
use it to go after extremely dangerous people like my brother and his gang.
;) That would be the ultimate turning of the tables or whatever. üòÇüòÅ That
would be a wonderful way for this whole thing to end, at least in my
opinion. üòâ

Regardless, I can‚Äôt wait to get this microchip removed tbh. That will be my
best Christmas present ever. However even then they can still triangulate
the sound to create x-ray vision‚Äìhowever the difference is then I will
actually have a chance at running to a place where they can‚Äôt easily track
where I‚Äôve gone in the first place. It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôve got to go
completely off the grid for a while somewhere..


A Little Later On...

I guess a 999 EF reading wasn‚Äôt the max on my EMF reader after all‚Ä¶ The
following EF reading was taken just this afternoon. I‚Äôm not joking about
the EMF stuff‚Äìit‚Äôs very real‚Äìthey do it daily. It can‚Äôt be healthy for me.
And their EMFs/EFs are only getting stronger.. (Like a lot freaking
stronger‚Äìthe following isn‚Äôt even the lightsaber ones I have been referring
to that they hit me with recently during the nighttimes.. Those ones are
literally like lightsaber beams. These were nothing compared to the
lightsaber ones)

Here check this out‚Äìthis shows just how capable at hacking cameras these
guys are. I hadn‚Äôt even touched this offline camera NVR system since I
reset it when I put all my cameras up in the eves‚ÄìI hadn‚Äôt even touched it
until just like yesterday when I finally plugged it into internet‚Äìand even
then I didn‚Äôt actually login and look at any of the videos or look at any
of the logs or anything until today. Just know it wasn‚Äôt even connected to
the internet for the majority of the time since I reset it.

I noticed something was fishy with my cameras misbehaving again which gave
me an inkling that they had hacked them again, which is why I looked into
them today.

And sure enough, look how they clearly got access to my NVR again
somehow‚Äìeven before I ever plugged it into internet again‚Äìeither by
breaking into my house yet again or else by hacking it‚Äôs wifi somehow or
else hacking the individual cameras themselves yet again, and look how they
do things that aren‚Äôt even possible through the NVR‚Äôs UI tmk. Like changing
the primary hard-drive for instance, logging into individual cameras,
changing the config ‚Äúdiscreetly‚Äù, etc, etc. Like I don‚Äôt even know how to
do any of that stuff‚Äìand like I said I hadn‚Äôt even touched it since the
beginning of December when the first logs were created. But yea, I‚Äôve never
even seen any of those options on the UI before when I did actually mess
with it prior to me having to reset it and try again this time. It‚Äôs
insane. P.s. I‚Äôm a web programmer not an IOT programmer btw. These guys are
clearly good at both.

I get the sense they want me to leave. But the question is why do they want
me to leave? Because I have too much support around here or what?
Regardless, I need to get the microchip out first. That‚Äôs my number one
priority as of right now. Then I‚Äôll probably leave.

I think they may have put something in my body wash. I now think that‚Äôs
what caused me to get hives the other day because I got them again today
only not as intense right after taking a bath just barely.

I got a whole bunch of random evidence like that just when you are ready
for it. From my vape juices to my tooth paste to my body wash, etc, etc.
Hopefully one day you‚Äôll know what to actually test it all for..

They keep cutting my internet whenever I try to do this illustration of my
ear.

Picture a satellite dish. You know the thing that sticks out and
essentially pushes signals down to the dish which then makes the signals
bounce back and expand out even wider so that they can go up to space or
wherever?

Now picture an ear. I suspect that‚Äôs exactly how this microchip was
engineered to work but with my ear. That small thing that sticks out on the
very front center of my ear is where I felt tremendous heat on my
fingernail when trying to block out the suspected signal with my finger. I
suspect it pushes the signals down into my ear and so they can bounce back
and expand out even wider just like with a satellite dish.

Appointment with an ear doctor is sometime next week.

As of January 4, 2022

Just some of the times I‚Äôve reported all this stuff. The list has grown
since then.

My latest fbi complaint.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ayOeO29H\_bIhHZwFiJT9oipxAYil7RIV&disco=AAAATmpMjH4

They have stopped using the super intense lightsaber emfs the last few
nights‚Äìthey only used those ones right before I was planning on returning
back to work. It was enough to screw up my whole schedule again though and
stop me from going back to work sadly.

Hopefully one day I‚Äôll be able to sue for damages. I‚Äôve never sued anyone
before but this is getting ridiculous‚Äìmy brothers gang are legit trying to
ruin my whole life for no good fucking reason and thus far at least they
have been doing so with impunity.

One thing I realized today about all the lies or whatever my brother made
up and spread about my mom previously is I think he may have actually been
referring to what he planned to do to me when he said those things, or else
he‚Äôs just been doing that same stuff to me since then for whatever reason.


 -

 Because Dusty talked shit on my mom‚Äôs teeth towards the beginning in
 2019. (I now suspect my brother‚Äôs gang may have put something in my
 toothpaste while they were in here, which started getting to my teeth,
 before I changed toothpastes; I read it‚Äôs a common gangstalking tactic)
 When I said I can‚Äôt trust anything in my house after they got in here‚ÄìI
 meant I really can‚Äôt trust anything‚Äìlike some people don‚Äôt get the severity
 of all this and the implications of them breaking in constantly for me.
 It‚Äôs no joke. It‚Äôs not easily fixable either.
 -

 My brother and my mom also had this strange narrative that they both
 apparently said the other was going to die a lonely death or something. (I
 don‚Äôt know who to believe‚Äìall I know is that is exactly what Dusty is now
 trying to do to me/force upon me, and my mom has not been helpful lately
 either)
 -

 Etc


And again, I still don‚Äôt really understand why exactly, unless it‚Äôs because
I started continuing my father‚Äôs legacy by buying another one of my
father‚Äôs buildings from my little sister Taylor, which is right around the
time when this all started, when the purchase agreement was finalized to be
specific. (i.e. Unless it‚Äôs because Dusty really is a serial killer who
truly despises our father as I suspect)

What are people going to do when there‚Äôs nobody left but Dusty, Cindy, and
Taylor? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. Like at some point it‚Äôs got to become
obvious who the imposter(s) is/are. It started becoming obvious to me back
when Dusty first started attacking me and Turbo in 2019. That‚Äôs when I
started truly realizing foul play likely really was involved and my brother
of all people was likely the culprit.

I still can‚Äôt believe how my mom completely flipped on me out of nowhere
this last September either. I have stood up for her all along. I can‚Äôt
believe she started lying and covering for Dusty out of freaking nowhere
when I could have used her support the most, (When Dusty first started
EMFing me) right after I got her a freaking job at my work even, after all
Dusty did to her/all the misinformation and lies he spread about her. She
started covering for Dusty‚Äôs hacking out of nowhere and she even freaking
lied about it‚Äìlike she straight up lied about it afterwards. And then she
started going on smear campaigns against me. And she hasn‚Äôt been helpful
ever since. I guess I‚Äôm now a potential liability to my mother as well as a
result, like it‚Äôs in her best interest now to never really tell the truth
or truly act motherly towards me in regards to all this ever again now.
(Because if she does she‚Äôll be implicating herself)

Like I don‚Äôt even know if she‚Äôll even be honest about the fact that I told
her how I saw how Dusty treated Karie on Karie‚Äôs deathbed after we left the
hospital that night Karie died at this stage. I know there are some digital
records on the topic out there somewhere though, like digital records of
when Dusty actually apologized to me for him treating Karie that way after
my mom apparently told Dusty I saw him do that. (Thanks mother) The whole
thing is just messed up. I know for damn sure there is corroborating
evidence on the topic out there however. (Like evidence of me bringing it
up again and again and not having her completely deny it later, etc, etc)

My mom used to believe me about Dusty btw, look no further than all the
references. (Still a work in progress btw) She‚Äôs not one who easily
forgives anyone either. She wouldn‚Äôt even meet with Dusty for like over a
year without anyone else present, she was thinking about suing him even.
She always used to say she believed me about 90 percent but just not the
gang stuff. Then out of nowhere, she said Dusty wants to meet up, she asked
me if I wanted to come with and I said no, right around the time Dusty
started amping up his attacks on me the most. Dusty like comes in now and
gets back to normal meanwhile he‚Äôs forcing me to be better off in not
talking to my mom now. All I‚Äôm saying is I do feel betrayed by my mother
and by Dusty. Talk to others in our family and you won‚Äôt get the same
reaction as my mom is now giving. Dusty said those things about her
originally for a reason and he has been working on trying to get me to
dislike my mom for a while now. But it never worked until she started
actively covering for Dusty. And now I‚Äôm just better off to stay away from
her for now I feel. At the end of the day I know my mother and my brother
both very well and I can tell when they are lying. I normally just forgive
my mom and move on but in this case too much is on the line for me to just
go along with whatever she's saying this time‚Äìplus I caught her lying for
Dusty and she doesn‚Äôt even try to hear me out anymore.Like I don‚Äôt know if
she understands that this really is life or death for me, I‚Äôm not stupid‚ÄìI
didn‚Äôt just go crazy‚ÄìI have doctors backing me on that fact‚ÄìDusty does this
shit to me daily and he makes it obvious to me it is him repeatedly just in
a way that requires a whole backstory to prove. So my mom just plays dumb
now or something and it‚Äôs just whatever. Like I‚Äôll just say she hasn‚Äôt been
helpful lately‚Äìbut for no good reason. At the end of the day I think my mom
feels it will reflect bad on her if Dusty really is who I now know him to
be.

I know it‚Äôs Dusty who is responsible for all the EMF stuff btw. Because I
have talked to him to get it to stop, amp up, or amp down at different
times essentially. Plus I live it every single day and I know Dusty is
behind all the hacking, my mom used to even admit that one.

[Link to September-December 2021 Dusty conversations here]

Initially Dusty even asked me what I wanted when I first turned him in for
EMFing me and he even sent some of his guys out to come get some of their
devices from the exterior of my house only to have them add them back the
very next day. (He was toying with me essentially) Don‚Äôt underestimate how
they can rig your house to become a giant death trap without your
knowledge. It‚Äôs insane what all they can do tbh.

Dusty amping up all his EMF stuff right before I planned to go back to work
is no coincidence either. Dusty has wanted me to quit my job for some time
now but for no good reason. There‚Äôs too many things like that where the
probabilities for it all to be completely random are just way too low to be
realistic. (Like for instance the whole thing with them admitting they
killed turbo recently‚Äìwhat‚Äôs the probability that my keyboard only bugs out
on me when I‚Äôm typing exactly tha one sentence one day, then my computer
plays some cemetery sound clip I‚Äôve never even played on my computer
previously when I‚Äôm typing about exactly what happened the previous day the
very next day, and like the very next day after that, my computer starts
playing some sound clips of turbo suffering that I‚Äôve never even heard
before‚Äìmeanwhile fireworks are going off in the background way earlier than
normal which sound like gunshots‚Äìat first I was excited to hear turbo again
but then I realized it was Dusty and I realized what he was doing and it
actually turned out to be another one of his sick and twisted
ploys/admissions sadly) But the probability of all that being completely
random is exponentially lower than the probability of it all going right
along with everything else I have alleged my brother has been doing to me
for some time now unfortunately. (Like it all fits a pattern, the
probability it is a continued part of that pattern takes the cake by a mile
or more‚Äìtime and time again)

Dusty is just good at what he does I guess; (Causing divisions, isolating
people, corrupting people through hacking, intimidating people, and even
killing people and getting away with it apparently) that‚Äôs how I see it
right now anyways..

It‚Äôs crazy to think how much grief Dusty has really caused so many people.

More stuff.

Here‚Äôs the time I turned Dusty‚Äôs Recording Studio in for being a private
gang hangout. Dusty ended up moving out of his place on 25th street shortly
thereafter, citing inability to keep down the noise on Facebook. (I get
what he‚Äôs saying nowadays‚Äìit‚Äôs virtually impossible to keep out his
infrasound‚Äìbut I did also turn his place in for being a gang hideout
shortly before they ended up moving)

My first fbi complaint ever.

I suspect it will take the police a little while to establish any fruitful
confidential informants and whatnot, based on a show I watched at least, it
could take up to one or two years before they are able to successfully
penetrate this group to the point where they are able to gather enough
intel to successfully bring criminal charges for things like what they have
been doing to me, at least to be able to bring those charges to the higher
up people from what I gather. And that‚Äôs assuming it‚Äôs a normal gang vs a
completely decentralized gang. (Which would take even longer to figure out)

I hope that‚Äôs what the police or the fbi are doing at least, they have
shown me solidarity or what I thought to be solidarity on at least two
different occasions previously, but I‚Äôll just end there. Bottom line is
I've got to figure this stuff out for myself for the time being and do my
best to stay alive, out of harm's way, and try and live as best a life as I
can in the meantime.

Random Thought

[Opinion]

Notice how dusty takes more offense to me suggesting he might have holes in
his brain from all the acid he‚Äôs done as compared to me suggesting he is a
serial killer? He didn‚Äôt even take offense to being called a serial killer.

I started reading up on gangs in Utah just recently and it turns out they
are evolving to look and behave more like full fledged organized crime
groups. Like they supposedly don‚Äôt even wear their colors all the time
anymore, beyond maybe shoe laces or a bandana or a belt.

I guess gang members take pride in being called killers. Like that‚Äôs a
compliment to them.. (Which fits with dusty perfectly)

I also read that some of the most notorious gang leaders use racketeering
and are so well insulated that they can‚Äôt even be prosecuted/touched
essentially. I hope that is not the case yet in Utah or with dusty. I now
suspect dusty might be guilty of racketeering, or using official businesses
to conduct illegal operations and/or to hide/launder illegal money. And I
do suspect dusty of being an organized crime boss of some kind.

Quick side note, now that I know what gang themed stuff looks like, I
recall Dusty having artwork that looks just like that in his house for as
long as I can even remember.

[Artwork similar to Dusty‚Äôs artwork that can be found doing a search for
‚Äúgang artwork‚Äù reference goes here]

I also read about different gang ‚Äúsets‚Äù, or groups within a gang, and about
how each different set has its own leader. The leaders have got to be the
brains behind the whole operation, so it would make sense to me if I were
law enforcement to go after the leaders or even the suspected leaders.

The only color indicator I‚Äôve gotten since all this began from my brothers
people is blue. But even that could be wrong, like it definitely hasn‚Äôt
been completely definitive or made obvious that‚Äôs for sure.

If a gang or organized crime group really has evolved to have all these
capabilities then that‚Äôs definitely not a good sign for Utah or this
country in my opinion. Like it‚Äôs hard to even tell these guys apart from
what a sophisticated foreign adversary might do. (Hacking and corrupting
people and businesses so as to make it to where it becomes in a lot of
people's best interest for the truth to not be uncovered, having people
across all different stereotypes working on their behalf and not all be of
the same nationality nor all fly the same colors, hiring contractors to do
some of their dirty work to make it harder to ultimately trace back to
them, coordinating it all in real-time from a centralized location,
employing cutting edge next generation weaponry, trying to hack peoples
minds I assume to be used for nefarious purposes later‚Äîassuming they are
able to actually pull it off, etc, etc)

In researching gangstalking previously I also came across something called
a snuff film and it being a potential result along with gangstalking. Aka a
film created of someone getting murdered in real life which is distributed
on the dark web to be watched by a jaded few. With all my brothers
relentless camera hacking and whatnot, especially given how they don‚Äôt even
technically need the damn cameras provided all their other capabilities; it
therefore sometimes seems like a snuff film could be a definite possibility
and even a way for them to be able to potentially monetize some of this.
Just anything and everything they could buy or sell on the dark web is what
they seem to be into pretty much. I suspect they could even buy a lot of
their drugs and poisons and weapons on the dark web tbh. (Including hitmen,
which I‚Äôve definitely suspected them of sending contracted hitmen after me
on at least one or two occasions‚Äîi.e. people who haven‚Äôt seemed to persist
but were there for at least one of the direct attacks) But proving that is
likely going to be difficult.

I do suspect dusty could have plans to harm more people. But I don‚Äôt know
any details beyond what I‚Äôve already provided and what I will continue to
provide going forward.

As of January 7, 2022

I guess my faraday cage hasn‚Äôt been working properly again. It‚Äôs tough to
get right tbh. Any loose connections can cause the whole thing to become
ineffective. And plus I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs best to have an existing charge
flowing through it or else to have it just be grounded or a third option
would be to have an inner layer that‚Äôs only grounded and an outter layer
that‚Äôs charged. (So one with positive current, the other with negative
current, to theoretically offset both positive and negatively charged emfs)

When my faraday cage worked tho I could hear all the electricity flowing
through the wire when they were trying to hit me while inside it
previously‚Äîlike there was so much electricity from their emfs that the
electricity was even jumping this gap causing a electricity flow buzzing
sound. That was before I ever added an existing current to it. (It was
essentially borderline overloading 12g wire from the current it intercepted
out of thin air) I added an existing current to it after a while cuz my
brothers gang seemingly uses different kinds of emfs that will get through
different kinds of defenses essentially. (So my brothers gang just pivoted
based on their latest Intel at the time once they realized I was
successfully blocking their emfs, they pivoted to something which would
still get through my defenses and wouldn‚Äôt even cause electricity to go
through the wire anymore, or maybe they just changed the angle, idk, but
yea so then I had to try and pivot myself‚Äîand then repeat‚Äîit never ends)
Bottom line is I shouldn‚Äôt even have to sleep in a f-ing faraday cage
however.

P.s. remember when I said they have been targeting me when I pee lately for
my brothers attempted mind control? And how I said I had to turn off all my
power so I could pee in peace? Guess what they did since? They somehow made
it so even if I turn off all my power to my house, their devices still
receive electricity somehow now. So now the only way for me to pee in peace
is by going elsewhere. But luckily my brother still seems to be on that
same stage of his attempted mind takeover.

I do recall when I had an electrician come take a look previously he noted
that I had more power inside in my electrical box than I had outside at my
meter‚Äîwhich he found odd at the time. Like it was reading 220 outside but
something like 230 or higher inside. (Which doesn‚Äôt make sense) And he said
my metal shelves in my garage holding current likely meant they must be
grounded somehow. (Even though my metal shelves in my garage are screwed
into wood studs)

I think my brothers gang uses natural satellites like that to do what they
do however, kinda like with my ear. They did the same thing with my bbq
grill which kinda forms a metal ‚ÄúU‚Äù shape to its main housing, which i
suspect might have also acted as a satellite for one of their devices. I
don‚Äôt know how they powered the damn thing tho unless they somehow rigged
my whole house to become a giant electrical field.

I‚Äôm going to get my faraday cage to be only grounded again and ensure it‚Äôs
successfully blocking electrical signals effectively again then go from
there. (By testing out putting my router in there and reading the emf on
the exterior compared to the emf reading when my router is just sitting on
the outside with no faraday cage surrounding it‚Äîbut even that isn‚Äôt an
adequate test cuz they use exponentially higher amounts of electricity than
my router puts out)

Suspicious car/suspected break-in

721MLM - UTAH - GRAY CAR - 4 Door - White younger stockier white male

This guy was clearly waiting for me to leave this evening when I was about
to drive out of my cul-de-sac and I spotted him acting kinda odd parked
right on the side of my yard towards the back like that‚Äìso I went his
direction instead to see if he‚Äôd stay put or what, he turned his hazards
lights on after he saw me and he parked literally right on the side of my
house towards the back. As soon as I got behind him to flip around, he
legit took off driving. So I followed him and got his plates just incase on
my way to go to get some food this evening. Then when I got home the first
thing I noticed when I walked in the door was I could smell a faint smell
of weed in my home‚Äìas if someone who had smoked weed had been in there and
didn‚Äôt realize they smelt as bad as they did. (Probably cuz they were high
lol) I had totally even forgotten about that guy by the time I got home
though pretty much‚Äìbut yea‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt smoke any weed‚Äìit wasn‚Äôt me. They must
have a key or something to my top notch locks even. (Probably through all
their hacking, cuz even all the top notch locks share some keys across
different purchases‚Äìso maybe they bought a lock from the same vendor?)

Still not sure if that guy got in my home afterwards or if the smell just
came through a window or something‚Äìbut with everything else that‚Äôs been
going on lately‚ÄìI wouldn‚Äôt doubt it if he or one of my brothers other gang
members did get in.


And to be perfectly clear‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even freaking turn my brother in until
he tried filling my prescriptions, acting all shady about my prescriptions
both before and afterwards, and not only that but until after he poisoned
me and my dog at the dog park, and all that bs, and not only that but until
after he poisoned me the next year and got me really good/bad via a key
that was left out at one of my buildings that time, (making it cross the
work boundary on multiple levels) and not only that but he had also
completely hacked the shit out of me and had been tracking my locations,
having people stalk me, etc, etc, and I won‚Äôt go any further than that but
just know it‚Äôs not like I was just being a dick just turning him in for
nothing and therefore now all this is justified against me‚Äîit‚Äôs quite the
opposite actually. I turned him in once I realized he was coming for my
jugular regardless of what the fuck I did or didn‚Äôt do about it. And even
beyond that‚Äînobody even took me seriously really until this year because I
didn‚Äôt push the freaking issue until he came after me even more times and
until he started sending his people after me and turbo literally daily. And
even still I‚Äôve given him plenty of opportunities and I just simply
elevated my reporting of it all each and every time. He really has given me
no other fucking choice. Sometimes I feel it‚Äôs as if this is what he wants
from me. Regardless, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm happy about it, believe me, I wish
he actually would have given me some kind of choice and left me the hell
alone. But it is what it is I guess. Here I am now with clearly a bounty on
my head. All I can do is try and make the best of it. And help ensure
others don‚Äôt have to go through my brothers corrupt, sick/twisted justice
system that only has one core value which is to protect Dusty from all his
previous murders at all costs. If you have damaging information on him you
are automatically guilty‚Äìand he‚Äôs the judge, jury, and executioner.

As of January 8, 2022

I do now suspect someone got in again yesterday.


They‚Äôve been putting that poison substance on my toilet seat lately, that‚Äôs
their latest fav spot to put it. I just washed off the toilet seat the day
before yesterday but after I suspect someone got in again now it was back
out of nowhere. I suspect they try and put it in places where I won‚Äôt
notice these days so that it can have the maximum effect by staying on me.
Normally plain soap and water won‚Äôt get it off either. Is that what
whomever did yesterday when they were in my house again? The smell of weed
did seem to be coming from that direction. I need to get out of here‚ÄìI‚Äôm
way too outnumbered. One of these days though I have a feeling all of this
will have been worth it.

Infrasound was coming from the child abuser's house again last night‚ÄîI made
damn sure that‚Äôs where it was coming from too. I know this one wasn‚Äôt
coming from my house.

What‚Äôs that guy even do for a living? Doesn‚Äôt seem to me like he does much
of anything besides staying up all night and infrasounding me. He‚Äôs the
only one I know of who I can tie to hackers besides my brother btw. I‚Äôd
like to hear what that guy claims to say when you ask him about it because
he‚Äôs been directly incriminated so many different times now it‚Äôs not even
funny. Like he‚Äôs obviously lying to someone about something. I‚Äôd like to
know how he makes his living.

Still awaiting the results of my GRAMA request..



As of January 10, 2022

[Opinion]

I believe my brother may be working with Russian Oligarchs and the gang
thing might just be a cover story or smoke screen. I believe my brother
plans to seek revenge on more than just me in our family for his despise of
our mother and his previous promise to her to make her die alone.

What‚Äôs the ultimate way to be evil? The ultimate way to be evil is by being
evil through other people so you yourself don‚Äôt ever get caught.

What is the ultimate way to be a hacker? The ultimate way to be a hacker is
by hacking into other people‚Äôs minds essentially. (By transcending
electronics)

These guys‚Äô advanced persistent threat hacking capabilities and their emf,
infrasound, extreme break-in capabilities, and their suspected
nanotechnology microchip capabilities are those which only someone like a
foreign adversary might realistically possess.

I believe my brother when seeking out how to get out of the bind he was in
relating to essentially knowing he was getting close to being caught for
murdering his own family‚Äìhe may have sought out help from Russian Oligarchs
on the dark web as a result, especially given the politics of the time.
(Around the time he initially hacked me and others in my family) And now
he‚Äôs on a vendetta against his whole family and this entire town‚Äìseeking to
do the one thing to his family that‚Äôs even worse than death‚Äìthat is‚Äìmind
control. He wants to essentially make some of us act out and behave in ways
that will essentially cause our whole family never ending suffering,
grievance, and shame and which will be the ultimate slap in the face to my
father, my mother and to this whole town. (Regardless of how he‚Äôs acting
now‚Äìwhen someone shows you their true colors‚Äìyou had better believe
them‚Äìit‚Äôs no coincidence my brother is acting like a perfect little child
now that the police are actually digging into all of this--don‚Äôt be fooled)



I believe Dusty plans to give the Russian‚Äôs more than just me within our
family as well, if that‚Äôs the case, assuming he hasn‚Äôt already done so.
(Potentially some of my mother‚Äôs kids‚Äô kids) I suspect they particularly
seek out those who are currently single.

[reference goes here]

I believe most of the people I have alleged are involved in these attacks
against me that have actually persisted could actually be secret Russian
agents/assets. (i.e. Child abuser guy, *cough, *cough, My brother, *cough,
*cough) The ones that don‚Äôt persist likely were hired contractors as
previously thought.

I suspect everything else could just be a smoke screen or cover story or
false flag operation meant to cover up the truth pretty much.

Now that right there would explain literally everything. Luckily for me
they‚Äôve been getting tripped up on any variances in my prescriptions from
day to day however‚Äîthank god. At one point I think they even thought I was
going to be a lost cause given my prescriptions which is when they tried to
kill me at the eagles. Since then I think they‚Äôve figured out a way to
adjust for any variances in my prescriptions from day to day but they still
appear to be struggling‚Äîagain thank god. But I do get the sense they have
done this before, whomever it is.

I therefore currently plan to move somewhere where I will be of no use to
either Russia or my brother. I plan to move to somewhere like Portugal or
somewhere like that, which isn‚Äôt Russia, but somewhere which still has ties
to the US, and somewhere which isn‚Äôt in the heat of all this political
nonsense and therefore will hopefully make me of little use to them.

(They started freaking out when I was writing the section above btw, like
as if they have now been caught‚Äìmy screen went blue and back to white hue
and back to blue hue again multiple times when writing this, as if multiple
people were logging in to view what I was writing at the time‚Äìdon‚Äôt let
them fool you‚ÄìI think this is the closest to the truth I‚Äôve gotten yet; The
beauty of what they are doing to me is that I can read them through all
their reactions to what I‚Äôm doing at any given point in reverse as well,
just like they can read me, I can also glean insight from their lack of
reactions at key times, etc, etc..)

This is my final answer at this time. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think of
that explains everything realistically.

Me personally, I‚Äôm not a good liar‚ÄìI‚Äôm not good at being fake either.
Programmers in general aren‚Äôt good liars because we deal with true and
false expressions all the time. Plus I have no motive to be doing any of
this besides to try and help out my family, stop all the harassment, go
back to work, and to do some good in this world. I therefore would hope you
will give all this adequate consideration because truth is stranger than
fiction and you just can‚Äôt make this stuff up; plus, at the end of the
day‚ÄìI assure you I have been telling you the truth to the best of my
abilities this entire time‚Äìregardless of how strange the truth may seem.

Thank you for coming along the journey with me, I think I have now found my
answer as to where I should move to. (Don‚Äôt worry, I plan to move to a
place where I am still accessible to the US if you guys need me for
anything)

Disregard all this at your own peril.

I‚Äôll leave you with an example of Dusty‚Äôs true colors, some messages Dusty
sent previously to my other brother Mikey, who is/was a
cop/firefighter/paramedic/life flight paramedic his whole life in Clinton‚Ä¶
üëáüëáüëá (It‚Äôs not me you guys, I‚Äôm just trying to help)

‚úåÔ∏è

Dusty‚Äôs True Colors

Here are a few of the messages Dusty wasn‚Äôt able to delete all traces of..
üëáüëáüëá


Please don‚Äôt fall for my brother Dusty trying to ruin my whole life as an
innocent person. üòî Dusty has been premeditating this stuff for years. The
only reason he didn‚Äôt act sooner I suspect was because I pointed out to him
the 5 year pattern of deaths in our family and how people were getting
suspicious. (At the time I said that to try and talk him out of continuing
to attack me)

Plus I wouldn‚Äôt be risking my whole career and everything else if I weren‚Äôt
100 percent confident most of what I allege against my brother is in fact
true and accurate. They freaking EMF and infrasound me every single night
starting right around the time I Iay down to go to sleep‚Äìevery single f-ing
night‚Äìthey are obviously trying to create an illusion. Do you know what
that does to me psychologically? It makes me fear going to sleep. Do you
know what all of this other stuff I‚Äôm being exposed to does to me
psychologically? It‚Äôs hard to even quantify tbh. But it makes me less
likely to trust others or goto the bars anymore, etc, etc. It‚Äôs called
psychological manipulation and mind control.

What the heck else am I supposed to do as an innocent person in this
situation? I‚Äôm being abused, I don‚Äôt know what else to say.

If you guys can‚Äôt investigate my brother due to jurisdiction issues or what
have you, then could you please let me know and I‚Äôll share all this with
someone who actually can investigate all this. It makes it tough when there
is more than just one person involved, because a lot of the crimes occur
here but the person(s) ultimately behind these guys coming after me to
begin with reside in another jurisdiction or else another country entirely.

But at the end of the day it‚Äôs not my job to investigate‚ÄìI don‚Äôt want to
jeopardize your investigations either. So I‚Äôll just stop there, just know I
was just trying to help rid this place of true evil and get back to work
myself. And know that I caught my brother in the first place for a reason.
(Because I‚Äôm extremely analytical, I‚Äôll admit this one is a lot
tougher‚Äîthey are essentially banking on you not seeing through all their
smoke screens in my opinion)

As of January 14, 2022

[Opinion]

Just wanted to reiterate that my brother and all his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are going to
keep indiscriminately killing innocent people right here in our hometown
and beyond until they get caught. This isn‚Äôt a joke. I‚Äôm the best person to
testify against Dusty that I know of‚Äîespecially relating to his suspected
past murders of my family. These guys kill in ways that are designed to
allow them to get away with murder over and over again‚Äîand my brother Dusty
is whom I suspect to be the criminal mastermind behind it all‚Äîor at very
least one or the leaders/shot callers. They wouldn‚Äôt even be coming after
me if it wasn‚Äôt for him.

It‚Äôs possible that no foreign countries are involved after all and all this
advanced technology they are using against me is all just the result of all
the dark money my brother and his gang have accumulated over the years. As
of right now they are determined to make my life miserable every single day
they can while I‚Äôm still in Logan‚Äîthat‚Äôs a fact. I have a feeling me being
in Logan is partly why I‚Äôm still alive tbh; but this is no life anybody
would want to live for any significant amount of time‚Äîhence why they are
doing all this to me‚Äîto try and discredit me while I‚Äôm here, make my life
miserable whenever they can, and ultimately to get me to leave Logan so
that they can kill me and get away with it given how so many people are
aware of all this here by now, or so I suspect. (Regardless of who my
brother is affiliated with these days‚Äîit really doesn‚Äôt matter who all is
in on all this to me beyond my brother anyways‚Äîthe only reason I want to
know is because I want to get away from them‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt and I likely never
will be able to at least until they face some kind of consequences‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt
even do anything to them after all until they started coming after me and
repeatedly; if they are willing to kill me and my dog turbo‚Äîthen they are
willing to kill literally anybody who is simply in the wrong place at the
wrong time in my opinion)

I‚Äôll refer back to what I stated in the beginning which is that people who
poison people can often end up getting away with 60+ murders before they
are ever caught. Like giving people cancer is a fucked up way to kill
somebody when you think about it, along with any other possible thing they
have already attempted, but all this and more is what I suspect these guys
are capable of. The worst part is anything they do is designed to where
it‚Äôs hard to catch them and ultimately bring the victims justice.

This appears to be a whole organization that specializes in poisoning
people and their animals in addition to making shady modifications to
peoples houses with an intent to either kill them or else to aid in
ultimately killing them. It‚Äôs also an organization that seems to excel at
the one area the police are said to be lacking, which is hacking and
internet related crimes. They even seemingly have specialists in different
areas and advanced equipment all geared towards allowing them to excel at
poisoning people for hell sakes. They even have their own freakin
intelligence department for christ sakes. Like common, this has got to be
treated with the level of seriousness that it deserves. The opportunity
cost of not taking all this seriously is simply too great in my opinion.

By now I would hope you or someone would have some inclination as to
whether I‚Äôm on the right track with all of this or not, exact from law
enforcements perspective‚Äîwhile taking into consideration false flag
operations and things that may not line up yet but could possibly line up
going forward‚Äîbecause it certainly seems to be have an extremely high
probability of being at very least mostly true to me, at least the general
direction of all of it and the fact that my brother is involved. For
instance, the last time I spoke to Detective Joseph Escobar I mentioned it
sounded like someone was blasting their music in the parking lot outside
the Marriott that previous night. That likely didn‚Äôt line up at the time,
if the cops reviewed the footage. However since then I‚Äôve been able to
correlate that subwoofer blasting sound to actually being targeted
infrasound and I‚Äôve been able to determine that it‚Äôs likely only directed
squarely at me. (Meaning the only way for you to hear it is if you were
within feet of me) So that‚Äôs one example that likely didn‚Äôt line up at
first but likely did line up later. I‚Äôll admit the latest one with that guy
outside my house did seem a little too easy but don‚Äôt give up on me
yet‚Äîthey do stuff like that intentionally as I‚Äôve been saying. (False flag
operations) At the end of the day you guys probably know more about all
this than I do. I just wish it could all be brought to an end sooner than
later that‚Äôs all‚Äîpreferably without me having to die, be mamed, or be
framed first.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I think they may have hired more hitmen to kill me yet again. I‚Äôve seen
enough of them now to have a good idea of a hitman when I see one. (who is
seemingly fixated on me) I can just feel it in the air these days. I‚Äôve
seen the look of a killer in my brothers eyes. I‚Äôve seen the look of a
killer in the eyes of a lot of the people my brother sends after me these
days. And I‚Äôve been through this long enough now to have a decent sense as
when my brother's gang might be planning something. (Which is seemingly
more often than not these days) They seem to usually send the hitmen out to
see who I am first before they actually direct them to strike, in this case
I suspect the reckon was done at Logan‚Äôs Hero‚Äôs just earlier tonight. I
called ahead and ordered food there a few hours ago‚Äîso I think they must
have ordered these latest hitmen there at that time‚Äîthere was up to three
of them this time or two groups‚Äîtwo white‚Äîone Tongan‚Äîall males likely in
their mid to upper thirties this time. The one white guy was wearing a
skull beanie and scary Halloween shirt. The other guys I noticed first cuz
they said something like that‚Äôs him and they were watching me. Then I
noticed the other dude who was also watching me but seemingly not in the
same group. And this was at a time right before closing. (The time before
this I noticed a white guy in a big white truck probably in his early
forty‚Äôs and a mixed race chick likely in her mid twenty‚Äôs‚Äîboth looked like
heroin junky‚Äôs at the maverick in nibley; (A few days later‚ÄîMurder by
overdose plot‚Äîtime when they tried to essentially kill me and frame me as a
heroin junky to the police I suspect‚Äîwith poison which made me feel wobbly,
thornbush spike I partially stepped on on my porch, some kind of drug I
suspect they added to my vape juice to make any autopsy show me as a drug
addict, suspected paraphernalia added to my bathroom garabage and kitchen
drawer, and the time when they seemingly lit off a drug smelling stink bomb
or some type of gas in my house which literally made my whole house start
wreaking more and more like heroin, made me feel funny, starting like an
hour or so after I had initially arrived home and started getting more and
more intense for literally hours thereafter‚Äîlike it was completely insane
but it was totally a plot to kill me and frame me as a heroin junky‚ÄîI
recall I didn‚Äôt drive for days afterwards just to be safe that time, see
above for more details, I think they also installed other smelling gas
capabilities to my hvac system around that same time, I suspect some might
even be used to knock me out so they can then implant me) Time before that
it was a white muscle military/paramilitary looking guy and his white wife
who clearly stated ‚Äúthat‚Äôs him‚Äù at the eagles, them and whom I suspect to
be their white muscle guy friend‚Äîall in likely their late thirties‚Äîat the
Eagles bar in Logan; but that time the reckon and the attack(s) themselves
were seemingly all wrapped into one 24 hour period. (Eagles incident or
Murder by suicide plot‚Äîtime when my brother completely misconstrued my
single email message to him and used it as an opportunity to report me as
suicidal to the police, a few days later kid came over for the seventh time
encouraging me to goto the bar essentially, whereas I was running late to
meet my coworker there‚Äîwith poison left by one of the muscle guys which
subsequently pulled all the blood from my extremities and almost killed me
and thorn bush spikes left all over my floormat in my car for the first
time‚Äîalthough none of the thorn bush spikes ever got on me that time oddly
but luckily))

But yea, those are the last few times I got this exact same vibe‚Äîeach of
which later resulted in an attack. I suspect the hitmen are now essentially
on standby until the hackers determine a good opportunity arises for them
to strike based on the hackers latest intel from what I gather based on
past experiences. It could be anywhere from tonight to a week from now or
longer.

Also, there could seriously be a tunnel to my house you guys. Back when
turbo was still alive one day out of the blue I honestly recall hearing
what I thought sounded like a tunnel being dug towards the north/north-east
side of my house at the time‚Äîbefore the emf stuff ever started happening
and before I even knew what gangstalking was. It sounded like somebody shut
off their noisy tunneling equipment or something that I hadn‚Äôt really
noticed until it was shut off‚Äîthen all the sudden I could hear people
talking (close by but muffled) and it clearly wasn‚Äôt from the tv‚ÄîI recall
it sounded like it was coming from the ground itself right outside my
master bedroom/main bathroom under my house tbh‚ÄîI remember exactly where I
was standing and where the sound was seemingly coming from and
everything‚Äîthe thought of a potential tunnel did cross my mind at the time.
However back then my brother and his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù were just in monitor mode so
I had no real reason to do anything more than create a simple mental note
at the time. But I do plan to look for a tunnel now lol, it‚Äôs just hard to
tell where the entrance might be if there even is one.

Since then I‚Äôve narrowed pretty much every other possible entrance out of
the equation‚Äîyou should see the freaking locks on my doors these
days‚Äîparticularly when I‚Äôm home I put latches up just like you have in a
hotel. But even still, they seem to still be getting in somehow‚Äîwhich just
makes it impossible to make any progress against these guys. And my newly
revived suspicions of a possible tunnel could be why they are now planning
something yet again at this time. But with my luck I‚Äôm not going to find
anything especially whereas I‚Äôm being harassed constantly which makes it
more difficult.. However I just figured I‚Äôd give you all a heads up just in
case anything happens to me..

‚Äî‚Äî

They gassed me again tonight through I suspect some attachment they added
to one of my printers that was somehow remotely activated to gas me on
their command when I was trying to get my computer free from viruses nearby
after getting home; I suspect they had other similar setups near my furnace
and in my garage area that they activated around the same time as well. My
furnace didn‚Äôt even have power at the time so i was able to rule out it
being from my hvac this time. Plus I heard a gas sound coming from my
printer when I think it was running out of gas a little later, which isn‚Äôt
a normal sound for my printer to make, which is why I suspect that was
likely the source of at least one of my rooms being gassed tonight. It made
me have egg burps the rest of the night. Then they infrasounded me
afterwards like they do every night. (The lovely neighbor guy, Kyle French
I believe is his name) No idea what their true intention was this time in
gassing me, it could be to try to get me to leave town or just to leave my
house for a while so that they can prepare something even bigger. Or it
could have been another legit attempt to take me out, idk. The gas smelt
similar and made me feel similar to the gas they used on me previously. It
made my nostrils like start to ooze as well. I think I‚Äôm going to report
this google drive folder to the fbi so that they have all the latest info
as well, just a heads up.

GRAMA request got denied. I heard from a previous property manager I used
just briefly that you could actually get access to other peoples utility
information‚Äîlike that utilities were publicly accessible. But it turns out
you can‚Äôt get access to other people's utilities after all, at least not
through a GRAMA request come to find out.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Like they are leaching off my
power adding various things to essentially harass me and cut my life short
in various different ways, intimidate me and make it so I can‚Äôt work
anymore, discredit me, etc, etc, but I‚Äôm still having high electricity
bills despite most my breakers being turned off for most the month as
previously stated but it still ultimately falls on me as the homeowner to
do something about.

P.s. I think their latest suspected hitmen have still yet to strike,
assuming my vibe was right at Logan hero‚Äôs earlier tonight. They had to
have installed that gas thing in my printer before I ever even crossed
paths with those guys earlier tonight.. So tonight could have just been a
ploy to get me out of my house so that they could do something much bigger.

Now I‚Äôm scared to go to sleep even more than before. Because my latest
enclosure has to be almost all the way sealed with foam insulation to keep
their freaking infrasound to a bearable amount. But if they added one of
their gassing devices described above in here then it would actually likely
prove fatal whereas I specifically have it set up with no gaps to keep all
their directed energy weapon sound out. They are always exploiting
vulnerabilities in literally every way like that. I do one thing to combat
their stupid uncalled for attacks, then they start using something that is
even more effective at harming me through what kept me safe from their
previous attacks. It‚Äôs messed up. I wish I had more help. I wish I didn‚Äôt
always have to be on the defense against these guys‚Äîbecause they are
absolutely ruthless. I‚Äôm not ready to die yet. I just want to live a normal
life. I don‚Äôt get why my brother hates me so much. They literally make my
life miserable daily and they show no signs of letting up anytime soon.

As of January 15, 2022

I‚Äôve been trying to avoid writing this because let‚Äôs be honest, different
people and different businesses reputations are on the line. But if you
have any questions about the validity of all my allegations against my
brother in terms of all his hacking then just call rent dynamics and speak
to Tim or Levi, the dev managers. I think they will at least tell you what
all he‚Äôs put me through previously in terms of all his hacking. To put it
simply, my brother has encouraged rent dynamics to step up its security by
essentially hacking into all my accounts including all my rent dynamics
accounts, I‚Äôll just leave it at that. Lastly, I have no doubt dusty has
changed up some of these files in this very folder/wording in this very
readme to better suit his agenda so just keep that in mind. I‚Äôve caught him
changing shit in this very google drive folder/readme more than once now.
But yea, Rent dynamics even got me a brand new computer to try and help me
get around all my brothers hacking fairly recently. My brother is just
smart about it and he has his sights set to where he knows what he wants
and in rent dynamics case he wants to isolate me so there‚Äôs no witnesses in
regards to what he is planning to do to me and so that he can further
discredit me without anyone to have my back‚Äîso it‚Äôs in his best interest
not to bring Rent Dynamics to its knees with all his hacking
essentially‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs not them he‚Äôs after in this case‚Äîit‚Äôs me. (He
already has tons of dark money anyways from what I gather) Other companies
I have no doubt Dusty could and probably has already brought them to their
knees before so that he could gain funding to buy all his new ‚Äútoys‚Äù he now
uses to come after me. (He doesn‚Äôt want to goto prison from what I gather,
but the mere fact he‚Äôs coming after me like he has been should speak
volumes of his guilt in regards to what I accuse him of being)

I know some of this is a little hard to believe but keep in mind that‚Äôs the
whole point. My brother is trying to discredit me and/or kill me so he
doesn‚Äôt have to worry about me testifying against him in court going
forward. My best evidence on him is my first hand witness testimony. He‚Äôs
been in the process of ripping that to shreds essentially, by attacking me
in ways that both make my life constantly miserable and which are hard to
prove and therefore sometimes hard to believe. Hence why I keep a journal
and try to help out in any way I possibly can.

Also, I‚Äôd call Dusty‚Äôs old work if I were you. GE Civil. I recall Dusty
saying something about them firing him at least in part due to some Russian
php plugin he installed at the time, or at very least he was complaining
about something to do with them not being appreciative or something about
it at the time of his firing. Plus I get the sense those are one of the few
people Dusty doesn‚Äôt have some sort of sway over in this whole circle at
this stage. (It‚Äôs fundamentally terrorism what he‚Äôs been doing) Especially
whereas Dusty seems to like to use his hacking to manipulate/intimidate all
the people around him/me into doing what he wants more than anything else.
(He likes to try and create divides in relationships based on things like
financial interest, (fear of going public about peoples businesses being
hacked, etc) he likes to try and corrupt people into doing what he wants
essentially‚Äîand in my case‚Äîhe likes to try to do attempted mind control on
me for whatever reason, maybe as punishment, idk‚Äîwhich is just yet another
slap in the face from him) I do believe Dusty is one of the main hackers if
not the main hacker behind all this tho. He enjoys harming people these
days‚ÄîI know that for a fact deep down. He associates fireworks to killing
people/my dog turbo. Unlike the rest of us who associate fireworks to
family, freedom, and country. Like that‚Äôs what gets him excited essentially
is harming others. He enjoys bringing others down. He never stops‚Äîthey are
infrasounding me as I type this.. This group is the boldest most in your
face, tamper with evidence, intimidate all witnesses person/group I‚Äôve ever
even heard of in my life. They are literally ruthless you guys. My brother
is the type of person that legit deserves to be locked up for the rest of
his life. (Sadly) But his whole perspective is you‚Äôve got to catch him and
nail him for it first.

Which makes it especially difficult when he and his ‚Äúpeople‚Äù constantly
tamper with evidence and witnesses, torture me, etc, etc, primarily through
hacking and dark psychology‚Äîbelieve me‚ÄîI‚Äôve been put through the wringer by
now and then some. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he killed me right in front
of all you guys at this stage tbh.

As of January 16, 2022

I stayed at a hotel last night due to fears of being gassed while I sleep.
I suspect they got in my house again while I was away, I know cuz I triple
checked all my locks before I left to ensure all the locks were locked and
the latches on my two garage doors were in the locked position, etc, which
they were‚Äîand when I returned home today the latch on my garage door that
leads into my house was in the unlocked position and my vanity lights were
on which I never turn on.

They seem to like my garage among other areas for some reason. (The only
entrance to my attic is in my garage as well tho) I have a feeling my
brother may be trying to create a story or narrative and then legit trying
to make that story or narrative come to fruition by staging things and
whatnot before/after he does kill me, like in terms of my garage and/or
whatever rumor they may have spread at the time; or anything else for that
matter, these guys adapt to the latest info constantly. To be clear I was
aware of the rumors he likely somehow spread about whatever he put in my
garage a long time ago, within likely days of him spreading them, and his
claims were meritless so don‚Äôt fall for anything like that please.

They emf‚Äôd me at the hotel as soon as I layed down last night btw, they
showed up there probably 5-10 minutes after I did show up and started
getting ready to emf me. (Calibrating their x-ray vision and whatnot) Then
like always, as soon as I laid down to goto bed they started hitting me.
They literally don‚Äôt let me out of their sights at all anymore.

They are essentially hunting me.

I suspect they track my car through my satellite radio somehow btw. (Which
seems weird but makes sense cuz the satellite radio likely works even when
3g onstar might not) I don‚Äôt even pay for serious satellite radio btw but
it was back enabled in my car again starting yesterday evening for the
first time since the Lexus dealership reset my cars computer and changed
out my car‚Äôs key signature for me. And I have been thinking of taking a
road trip soon so quite the timing on their part. I started to suspect
their ability to track me through my car was via my serious xm a few weeks
back, and this only confirmed my suspicions.

I did some research yesterday on all this infrasound stuff. I‚Äôll share the
results of my findings shortly.

My best way I‚Äôve found to try and stay alive though all this is well for
one to protect myself anyway I can including doing things like a freaking
faraday cage, and for two to try not to let dusty set the stage to get away
with my murder in any possible way essentially. (Which is extra tough when
they torture me/try and isolate me constantly and interfere with my sleep
nightly, making it harder to do anything or keep up with anything like a
normal person really) Like he seems to only actually try to kill me (rather
than just torture me) when he can fit all the latest information that the
police might see when they find me into some narrative that the police
could potentially fall for and he‚Äôs only able to do all that when he has
complete and total access to all my
information/whereabouts/cameras/devices‚Äîbut he freaking cheats and has some
exploit that is seemingly impossible to stop once he‚Äôs in‚Äîand he tries to
fit even minor things like a single message I sent him that could possibly
be interpreted as me being down into his narrative which gives him an
excuse to kill me in his mind. (That‚Äôs probably why they always hack my
cameras btw even tho they don‚Äôt even need to given their x-ray vision
capabilities, is cuz that‚Äôs totally how my brother thinks about all this is
from the police's perspective and what the police would see once I were
dead, etc‚Äîbut the main difference is Dusty is the attacker doing most of
this stuff to me in the first place, he just doesn‚Äôt want to get caught is
why he and all his hitmen likely approach it all that way‚Äîand I think it‚Äôs
worked for him previously..) I‚Äôm constantly catching my brother trying to
create a narrative like that so he can kill me, even the first poisoning he
did that.

As of January 17, 2022

One of my prescriptions started making me feel all wobbly again just out of
nowhere today. Last night I figured out a way to temporarily block their
infrasound by essentially using my own speaker system paired with a
frequency generator app on my phone to make my stereo system put out a
combination of 3 different frequencies all lower than 20hz. (By creating my
own infrasound essentially, but mine is nowhere near as sophisticated or
directed or harmful as theirs‚Äîbut it‚Äôs okay cuz the goal is to flood their
infrasound detectors which is what I suspect allows them to do their X-ray
vision and whatnot in order to allow them to harrass me using sound‚Äîwhich
is annoying as hell) So yea, seems I had success with jamming their
infrasound last night, and seems I was a little scared to sleep in my
normal enclosure due to fears of being gassed while I slept and not having
time to tear it all apart and go through every square inch of it, I slept
in my own bed/room for once last night but there were lesser security
measures in place‚ÄîI was tired tbh.

Anyways, now today my one medication is making me feel all wobbly out of
nowhere again, well I had to narrow it down to figure it out. And I protect
my prescriptions these days like they are my most valued possession‚ÄîI keep
them on me at all times for this exact reason‚Äîso that they can‚Äôt try and
poison me through them again. (I keep them on me at all times beyond when I
goto sleep) But yea, they must have gotten to them last night somehow even
though my cameras don‚Äôt show anybody going through the front door and my
camera was rolling literally full time last night, hence why I suspect a
tunnel even more now. I have a better way to know how to be able to tell
whether or not they tampered with my prescriptions definitively this time
and it seems as though they totally did again. It looks like they must have
used an air brush or something to spray something on there, when looking at
my prescriptions today under a black light. My prescriptions hadn‚Äôt made me
feel this way since I last reported suspected tampering with my
prescriptions btw.

This is not a mint‚Äìthis is one of my prescription pills under a black
light. Those white specs represent inconsistencies that shouldn‚Äôt be there.
(aka. Poison seemingly airbrushed on there) They are only visible under a
black light. Those specs are enough to completely make you almost tip the
hell over. It was difficult to get a good picture of it, it‚Äôs easier to see
it in person yourself.


They have got to have a tunnel, either that or they went through a window.
Dusty would be a person who could actually engineer a tunnel around the
existing infrastructure too seems he used to be a civil engineer. My bets
are on a tunnel leading directly to Kyle French‚Äôs house if there is a
tunnel. (Aka child abuser) All I know is I cannot keep myself safe here any
longer. Them potentially getting in my house while I am sleeping is creepy
as hell. And that‚Äôs what I suspect whereas my pills didn‚Äôt make me feel
this way the day prior.

They were able to still emf me last night despite my infrasound jammer and
they were even showing signs of getting around my infrasound jammer after a
while whenever they could figure out the exact frequencies of infrasound I
was putting out through all their other gadgets/hacking; I suspect they
could then filter those frequencies out. But yea, I honestly don‚Äôt know if
I can keep myself safe anywhere anymore tbh.

I have a sneaking suspicion that this is exactly how dusty killed our
father btw, after first trying the thornbush spike thing‚Äîis by tampering
with his prescriptions in similar ways. Cuz think I‚Äôm feeling wobbly, think
of a higher dose of this‚Äìmy dad had a lot of prescriptions‚Äîit could totally
result in me falling face first into the ground without even being able to
put my hand out like my father did when he passed away. Just saying. These
days I‚Äôm very careful with my prescriptions and everything else for this
exact reason.

They plan to kill me right in front of you guys I think‚Äîregardless of
whether they can create some narrative or not at this point. There might
still even be a monetary incentive for them. I‚Äôm getting close to possibly
switching my trustee now, which could also be why they are now trying to
hurry again. Either that or they are hoping to scare me away and then kill
me‚Äîbut I really do think each of these attempts are legit attempts to kill
me.

I wish someone would just arrest my brother already. I know it doesn‚Äôt
work that way but still. Do you know how many times he‚Äôs tried to kill me
by now? I‚Äôve honestly begun to loose track, it‚Äôs got to be in the twenty‚Äôs
or thirties by now at the very least and that‚Äôs if you count all the emf
and infrasound stuff as being one attempt each‚Äîeven though he does those to
me literally daily.

P.s. their infrasound capabilities in my house stem from my Hvac system
somewhere I suspect. Their infrasound device has got to be tied into my
hvac somewhere somehow. I found an article created by nasa which states
that‚Äôs one way to create infrasound is by putting a mic up in your hvac
somewhere essentially that records infrasound from the atmosphere that I
suspect they could then tune and use to infrasound me, and my hvac is where
I‚Äôve suspected it being for some time now just based on following the sound
itself, (they alternate between my hvac, the Kyle French guys house, and a
mobile car crew essentially) plus having it in my Hvac allows them to
infrasound me from any room in my house without having to risk having
people outside in cars constantly or having to risk the Kyle French guy
doing it to me even during the day times, etc, plus then it‚Äôs using my own
power and not theirs, etc, etc.

I don‚Äôt know what they did to make it so it could still be at least
partially powered when all my breakers are off tbh, but they added that
capability when I started turning all my breakers off so I wouldn‚Äôt be
bothered every time I had to use the restroom recently.

I‚Äôll post all the references here when I get a chance. They‚Äôve been
stepping up their attacks against me lately again tho, just fyi.. (it‚Äôs
terrorism‚Äîwhat they are doing is legit terrorism‚Äîthey are scaring everyone
around here)

As of January 18, 2022

I‚Äôve been running out of options. Seems how Dusty seems to want to stay
away from me so bad, and seems how I feel I got a good sense of what
Dusty‚Äôs boundaries are, (i.e. he‚Äôs not going to just shoot me or have
someone else just shoot me cuz his goal is to get away with it) I figured
I‚Äôd try going down to see if I could get some sleep outside his house in my
car last night just to see what would happen. So I did just that, it‚Äôs one
of the only things I haven‚Äôt tried before this point I feel.

What happened was I suspect they may have sent someone to follow me all the
way down there, I suspect after I wrote the post about serious xm they
might have disabled that capability, which is partly why I write these
things is cuz it sometimes gets them to stop doing shit, but what is
important is they seemingly had the car following me turn away or stop
following me right when I was getting real close to my brother‚Äôs house.
(It‚Äôs as if they didn‚Äôt even want the people they hire to follow me knowing
where my brother lives is what I felt at the time, but I could be
wrong‚Äìthey do follow me everywhere I go these days though if nothing else
just to infrasound me everywhere I go and to try and make my life
miserable) Anyways, I parked next to my brother‚Äôs neighbors house towards
the rear of my brother‚Äôs house and decided seems I can‚Äôt go anywhere else
without them doing this shit to me, might as well try here.

Shortly after I had arrived, someone I suspect came out of Dusty‚Äôs house
and walked right past my car in the dead of night; then shortly after that
guy walked past my car, I saw a car pull out from the road behind me on a
perpendicular street where that guy seemingly went on foot and then they
seemed to pull further down the street from where I was parked in my car..
(It was as if that dude who came out of my brother‚Äôs house parked his car
away from my brother‚Äôs house intentionally btw, so as to make it look like
only my brother was home or something)

Anyways, I just wanted to see if they would infrasound/emf me while I was
there. And they did, it started coming from the rear where I suspect that
guy went in his car‚Äîbut it was not as intense as they have done it to me
elsewhere. I think that dude that I suspect came out of my brother‚Äôs house
actually went and got in his car and pulled around to infrasound me from
the rear himself tbh. I got the sense that they didn‚Äôt want these other
people that were following me anywhere near Dusty‚Äôs house‚Äìso they went and
did it themselves given how I was close to Dusty‚Äôs house myself. (For
whatever reason) And I got the sense they didn‚Äôt want my brother‚Äôs
neighbors being tipped off to the infrasound hence why it wasn‚Äôt as intense
there.

It made me suspect dusty is either high up in some gang again or else the
whole operation is run off the dark web and anonymous in nature. (Which if
it‚Äôs the latter then that means it would theoretically be a lot easier to
put an end to all this in our local area, simply by arresting the person
hiring all these shady people to come here)

I‚Äôve gotten the sense that Dusty doesn‚Äôt want to be around me before he
kills me so that he can avoid questioning or potential
liability/culpability later. Either that or he‚Äôs trying to frame me,
idk‚Äìbut keep in mind he‚Äôs been staying away from pretty much everybody
lately. (Besides his new ‚Äúpeople‚Äù I assume) So yea, assuming he doesn‚Äôt
want to be around me to avoid criminal culpability or whatever, and this
may have been the wrong move on my part to go down there at all, but I
don‚Äôt want to die so I just figured I might as well go to his freaking
house is how I see it at this stage‚Äìseems how I‚Äôve already tried pretty
much everything else. If they follow me to hotels, if they follow me to my
rental house and start messing with that just due to a small possibility of
me actually moving in there given all their harassment at the time, if they
follow me to Murray, if they follow me to walmart and home depot and
everywhere else literally daily, etc, etc‚ÄîI have no doubt they will follow
me literally anywhere. (Assuming they know where I‚Äôm at which they do) So I
really have tried almost everything besides moving completely out of
country or completely off grid, etc.

Staying away from Dusty obviously hasn‚Äôt been working in and of itself tho.

Plus I also kinda just wanted to show Dusty I‚Äôm human again, and make it
more real to him in his mind at this stage, and to show him what he‚Äôs doing
to me first hand. (Seems it‚Äôs all mainly digital to him I suspect) And I
wanted to have the record show I was recently at least in the vicinity of
Dusty to try and dissuade him from continuing to have his hitmen try and
kill me‚Äìincase that really is part of his plan is to stay away from me to
avoid questioning later‚Äîas I have suspected for some time now.

I didn‚Äôt ring his doorbell or anything like that I just chilled there and
got some shut eye. Dusty‚Äôs car was there when I fell asleep and was gone
when I woke up‚Äîbut I have a feeling they knew I was around.

But yea, I came back home immediately after I woke up but I‚Äôd still really
like to know what Dusty has been up to lately and I‚Äôd like to get my own
take on his demeanor and whatnot at some point myself firsthand‚ÄìI haven‚Äôt
been able to find out from anybody else in regards to what he‚Äôs even like
these days or what he‚Äôs even really truly been up to because he seemingly
intentionally stays away from pretty much everybody else these days.

I‚Äôm scared of Dusty but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm more scared of all the people Dusty
sends after me than I am of Dusty doing something to me directly in person
himself at this stage. And I‚Äôm more scared of things not changing vs taking
a risk to go to his house to help rule some things out essentially. So yea,
that‚Äôs what I did last night and that‚Äôs why I did it. I can‚Äôt freaking stay
here, I can‚Äôt freaking stay in a hotel, I can‚Äôt freaking go anywhere tbh
because they follow me and torture me and try to kill me everywhere I
go‚Äìeverywhere besides apparently in the vicinity of my brothers house.

Will I do that again? Probably not, at least not without Dusty‚Äôs
permission. That‚Äôs my next test for him btw, is to ask his permission for
me to stop by sometime. Last time I invited him to the counselor his first
response was it sounds like a trap. (Insinuating it would be like a police
setup against him or something) But I guess we will see. Whether I actually
will go to Dusty‚Äôs house or not and actually go inside if he does actually
say yes, idk, we‚Äôll see I guess. But regardless, his response or lack
thereof should tell me something and that‚Äôs the point. I can‚Äôt just hack
him for information like he does with me after all, I‚Äôm too hacked to even
learn hacking at this stage‚Äìplus it‚Äôs illegal. And I can‚Äôt just send people
out to gather information on him for me like he does with me either, I
simply don‚Äôt have the resources.

Since I got home I got another strange voicemail message left on my phone
today btw.

I also discovered since I got home that the hackers had created their own
wireless mesh network across all of my various routers when I noticed that
one of my ssids that I had created previously was still showing up as being
an active ssid on my computer even though that particular wireless router
has been unplugged for weeks now. (So it shouldn‚Äôt have been showing up as
an active network essentially) Plus the password to that network had been
changed as well, so I couldn‚Äôt even join it. So I downloaded some apps to
try to narrow down where that ssid was still being broadcast from and it
turned out it was being broadcast from literally everywhere. My arlo hub,
my eero router, my comcast issued gateway‚Äìthey were all seemingly
satellites for the hacker‚Äôs network somehow even though they all are
completely separate brand routers and they all have their own separate
uses/ssids themselves. Like the hackers somehow created a mesh network
across all my various routers that aren‚Äôt even compatible with each
other‚Äìespecially like my arlo hub‚Äìarlo doesn‚Äôt even give you the password
to the wifi it broadcasts‚Äìthat one just works as a hub to my cameras
automatically through the app. How it could be rigged to become a satellite
on a greater network, I have no idea. That one doesn‚Äôt even have it‚Äôs own
router configuration portal or anything I don‚Äôt think, cuz you can‚Äôt even
join the network by default. And I don‚Äôt think the comcast gateway‚Äôs portal
even allows you to set it up as a satellite in a greater mesh network with
other brand routers like that either. Idk, all I know is I‚Äôve since
unplugged them all as a result. (I‚Äôm currently on my phone‚Äôs hotspot)

I think dusty must now be mad I turned his 25th street location in for
being a gang hideout or something, which is why he‚Äôs now trying to make my
life miserable daily. But he never takes any responsibility for anything
himself‚Äîhe always blames everyone else for everything. Maybe don‚Äôt fucking
make your recording studio a gang fucking hideout in the first place. Maybe
don‚Äôt go poisoning your little brother and his dogin the first place for no
fucking reason, maybe don‚Äôt kill your whole fucking family in the first
place, etc, etc. Like it‚Äôs just whatever. He was determined to kill me
anyways to begin with so it doesn‚Äôt make much difference to me. He acts
like he can just do whatever he wants with impunity and I just have to shut
up and accept it or else. He‚Äôs turned into a spoiled little brat or
something tbh‚Äîof the worst possible degree.

I‚Äôd fucking follow Dusty to see where he goes during the day if I were you.
He‚Äôs all about taking advantage of stereotypes and using them to his
advantage. Just cuz he may wake up early and leave doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs going
anywhere respectable. Hence why he‚Äôs trying to forcibly make me fall under
a given stereotype in reverse‚Äîcuz he‚Äôs a modern day Charles Manson
essentially‚Äîhe studies that shit. But yea, if you follow him on a normal
day he will likely lead you right to his new gang hideout would be my guess
anyways. His recording studios address is listed as his home address these
days and he‚Äôs listed as working at his recording studio. So where the hell
is he going during the daytimes then? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.

I feel you could do Ogden and Logan a huge favor just by deeply
investigating Dusty. He has got to be the brains behind his whole criminal
organization. He‚Äôs what allows them to do such sophisticated shit which
involves physics and civil engineering, precise targeted energy weapons,
etc, etc‚Äîassuming it really is just a gang. Dusty also had quite a bit of
our dads money to throw around at one point too. So he‚Äôs arguably the bank
behind the whole operation. (He‚Äôs the one who paid for the hideout in the
first place) And with all his hacking, he‚Äôs arguably the eyes and ears too.
Taking all that away from an organization this ruthless and evil by simply
arresting one person would be huge.

My main beef is with my brother‚Äîhe‚Äôs the whole reason these people are
coming after me to begin with. And he‚Äôs the one I suspect is ultimately
behind killing my family unlike these other guys. Talk about a shitty role
model. Our parents didn‚Äôt fuck our lives up‚Äîdusty did.

You would think they would have another gang or something to go after
instead, or else something better to do than go after regular civilians.
Like that‚Äôs what makes them so dangerous. It‚Äôs literally a terrorist
organization in that regard more so than it is a gang. I didn‚Äôt even know
whether it was true previously about his recording studio being a gang
hideout‚ÄîI just submitted a tip based on putting two and two together and I
only did so to try and get him to stop trying to fucking kill me. But
apparently I must have been right on that one, because it sure seems like
they are now trying to make my life miserable daily as a result. They
wouldn‚Äôt have even found out had Dusty not hacked me to try and kill me to
begin with so again, all this is extremely predictable and Dusty is just an
extremely deadly spoiled brat in my opinion. He uses whatever ammunition he
can against me to hype up his gang to come after me to try and save
himself. But in reality, Dusty is currently 2 for 2 in regards to tearing
apart every family he‚Äôs ever been a part of, only time will tell if he goes
3 for 3‚Ä¶

Hacking gang which essentially hacked/stole/got access to CIA governmental
mind control program pretty much explains it. (Anonymous maybe?) i even
read that somewhere. I was caught between gang and government but turns out
it might be a combination of both. Good luck ever getting a warrant through
my brothers phone btw. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs best if I just get out of
here and run from my brother. They have essentially NSA level capabilities
I suspect from years as a witness.

Check it out, a side effect of Dusty‚Äôs constant barrage of extreme EMF
radiation against me is it is essentially like giving me cancer on
steroids, as compared to what is described in the following video which
talks about merely normal levels of EMF radiation..

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J9dplmfFvUkcB7J7nirmRd1k0dh7P3LA/view?usp=sharing


I swear to god Dusty gave Karie cancer as well. He just likely did it in a
different way that time I suspect. He likes to kill people in horrendous
ways. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that Dusty treats other human beings as barbie
dolls in ‚Äúhis‚Äù own personal world/dollhouse. He apparently thinks it‚Äôs
‚Äúfun‚Äù from what I gather.

Dusty‚Äôs intentions at this time are quite simple‚Äìmake my life miserable
daily from here on out, experiment on me for his own personal
knowledge/pleasure, (With zero contributions to science I might add) and
kill me‚Äìjust like he did with the rest of our family.

All Dusty does these days is figure out the best way to hunt/kill people
and get away with it I swear. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve now devoted my whole life to
combatting him pretty much. (Well that and because Dusty is literally
forcing me to‚Äìhe‚Äôs given me no other choice pretty much) Dusty and his
anonymous hacker gang I mean. If I were them I would come forward before
it‚Äôs too late. Dusty is sabotaging you guys on purpose. He does that shit
to everybody. So much for anonymity at this point I guess.. (We all know
who he is) It‚Äôs almost as if Dusty might actually feel a little bad or is
getting bored or something and he actually wants to get caught at this
stage.

I now suspect Dusty may be their de-facto ‚Äúset‚Äù leader btw. I sometimes
think Dusty wants everyone to know just how much he really despised our
father once and for all, and to show everyone just how capable he really
is/was, and who better to show everyone all that than me? (His little
brother, who also happens to be a programmer and who is one of the few
actually capable of recognizing exactly what‚Äôs actually going on and how it
relates to our upbringing and one of the few capable of showing everyone
all the different ways he‚Äôs slighting our father, etc‚Äìalthough I‚Äôm not
capable enough to stop it all sadly) Dusty even told me once when this all
officially began back in 2019, that he‚Äôs now essentially too old to have
kids at this point (In his mind at least) so now he‚Äôs just going to mess
around with the remainder of his life and have fun and he doesn‚Äôt care what
happens or something.

Everything Dusty does is for a reason; and in my case, he has no other real
good reason to have ever even started coming after me like he has been ever
since 2019‚Ä¶ (Not even in his mind I mean, maybe just to see how well he can
manipulate you hackers into actually following him but that‚Äôs it‚Äìhe went
all Charles Manson on everybody back in 2019) Regardless‚Äìyou have been
warned. Anonymity is smart and all but people tend to crave recognition for
what they‚Äôve done at the end of the day and a fully anonymous life/gang
can‚Äôt be all that fulfilling. (Just sayin)

Technically it‚Äôs never too late to do the right thing.

‚Äî-----

A few reasons I suspect my brother may have access to secret NSA technology.

He specifically targets modems/routers.

His malware is capable of hacking a whole network of people through a
single infection.

His malware seems to be run mostly autonomously using AI.

He frequently conducts man in the middle attacks.

He is capable of essentially using some kind of x-ray vision to even
‚Äúwatch‚Äù what I type at any given time, using sound.

I suspect he may even have screen reading capabilities, which he can use to
somehow ‚Äúwatch‚Äù the screens on devices that are not already infected.

He carries out DDOS attacks on my home network regularly and takes down my
internet at will.

He has a whole network of break-in specialists at his disposal.

He is able to hack literally anything and everything including my routers,
modems, firewalls, NVRs, my car‚Äôs ECU, satellite radio, august smart lock,
nest thermostat, ring video doorbell, arlo hub, linux machines, macos
machines, windows machines, even virtual machines, ios devices, android
devices, smart tvs, he‚Äôs able to root devices, he‚Äôs even able to hack
things like my freaking water heater and furnace, brand new devices, old
devices, tablets, IOT devices, cameras themselves, sim cards themselves,
external storage drives, etc, etc.

He uses exploits that are nowhere to be found online. (Beyond NSA malware
descriptions)

He is clearly attempting some kind of secret mind control program.
(Realistically speaking, which is also a secret CIA program)

He is even capable of secretly and strategically planting what I suspect to
be neural smart dust implants and using them to send/receive signals
to/from the surrounding environment, using them as part of a greater
network of devices.

He utilizes equipment/technology that only the government should
realistically have access to.

His malware reminds me of the following NSA malware descriptions:

P.s. I noticed no ports were open on my router anymore tonight which is a
plus. (I think) He‚Äôs still on my computer however..

My infrasound jammer has been working lately to help me fall asleep better
at nights with less interference from them but they figured out a way to
disable it after I fall asleep now so I‚Äôve now got to figure out how to
ensure it stays on all night and how to prevent them from messing with it.
They can somehow cause me to sleep for pretty much as long as they want if
they are able to disable it‚Äîeven if I‚Äôm not even tired to begin with. (I
remember when they first caused me to sleep forever tbh, it‚Äôs insane they
can even do that) But yea, they somehow caused me to sleep something like
14+ hours last night, and I had something important to do today too.. (They
always try their best to make me look bad to strategic people) They also
hack my phones and make it so I don‚Äôt even receive inbound calls on my end
anymore. (Hence making me look bad as well for not answering my phone) But
I‚Äôm to the point where I just need to start over, I‚Äôm too hacked to even
try to stop any one thing anymore pretty much. I‚Äôve tried‚Äîand tried‚Äîand
tried‚Äîand tried to combat them on every single different thing but it‚Äôs
pointless when they can obtain physical access to my house at any given
time of their choosing pretty much, and I‚Äôm simply too hacked to be able to
make any real progress on any front at this point is how I see it. So I‚Äôve
got to start over elsewhere.

I've got the car portion of my plan pretty much behind me now. (Getting
close at least) But my passport might not show up for another 2-4 weeks
apparently..

As of January 24, 2022

I officially decided to proceed forward with a new trustee today. He‚Äôs a
lawyer. He‚Äôs going to help me file an injunction against my brother Dusty,
among other things. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like Paul; and change is
extremely hard. I just know how powerful Dusty is and I know how easy it
would be for Dusty to gain influence over this whole town essentially just
given Dusty‚Äôs insane capabilities and given this towns small size and it‚Äôs
very nature of doing business and whatnot, (all dusty would need to do is
corrupt the right person and then he could essentially force that person to
exert their influence according to Dusty‚Äôs wishes over everyone else,
including those who may actually interact with someone who interacts with
me essentially, or else corrupt the person who actually interacts with me
directly I guess‚Äîwhich I‚Äôm not saying that happened I‚Äôm just saying) and
plus‚ÄîI‚Äôve just wanted to try a new trustee for a while now and I‚Äôve known I
needed my own lawyer who actually represents my best interest and nobody
else‚Äôs for a while now as well‚Äîespecially given all this with my brother.
Whether this is the right decision or not‚Äîonly time will tell. The only
real alternative is more of the same and more draining my trust without
Dusty allowing me to go back to work and letting Dusty walk all over me
while staying quiet myself essentially from what I gather. At least with a
lawyer I‚Äôll have a chance to recoup some of my lost wages and some of the
damages, etc‚Äîeven if Dusty does kill me. At least now if he does kill me
then my estate can still seek damages on its own, and if anything, the
amount of damages my estate will be able to seek will only go up if so. So
in my mind, yea lawyers cost money, but I think of it more like an
investment because I know first hand the only route to resolve all this
leads directly through my brother and I already know what will happen if I
don‚Äôt hire a lawyer.

Dusty has shown me he has the power to make this all stop multiple times
btw, just long enough to show me he‚Äôs ultimately the one behind it each
time‚Äîprior to instructing them to continue the torture a day later, etc.
(He can also make it go harder which he does that frequently) My goal is to
figure out a way to make it all stop and for good this time. Without going
broke and without losing my life or my health or my career or my mind in
the process. And the only way I can see to do that at this time is through
a lawyer, at least while the police are still investigating.. (I don‚Äôt
think I have a lot of time remaining btw, see second to last paragraph in
this section for more details)

After I talked to my new trustee, I realized I should probably text Dusty
and clarify to him that I had no real intention of stopping by his house
anytime soon, and i informed him how I was mainly just interested in
knowing his reaction to my question the other day is all‚Äîespecially whereas
he set a red line refusing to discuss the huge elephant in the room with me
upfront in regards to all his hacking and harassment anyways; but yea, I
informed him I actually plan to move far far away from him, etc.

That went about how I would expect. Dusty is shady as hell and he‚Äôs rude as
hell these days and he clearly wasn‚Äôt being genuine at all. He clearly
doesn‚Äôt care about me whatsoever. He‚Äôs clearly trying to create his own
narrative without even hearing me out or trying to help whatsoever. (Which
could mean he was setting me up to call another shot against me again
soon‚Äîthat‚Äôs probably the last time I‚Äôll talk to the ‚Äúformal‚Äù Dusty for a
while‚Äîthe ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù version of Dusty on the other hand is almost
impossible for me to escape these days given how deeply he‚Äôs hacked me) The
‚Äúformal‚Äù Dusty even made one or two slight references to what I wrote in my
notes earlier today in his responses back to me over sms earlier which I
found odd.

One thing I wanted to add that I haven‚Äôt had a chance to add here yet is
that these hackers actually played that sound clip of turbo suffering to me
repeatedly over a period of days since I originally told you about it
pretty much, sometimes louder than others, after that first time when I
told you about them admitting to killing Turbo and playing that sound clip
to me originally. It‚Äôs messed up. Poison/torture my dog, record a sound
clip of it, then use the sound clip to torment me later repeatedly. These
are the people I‚Äôm dealing with. This is who my brother really is
apparently. He straight up fooled me for ~30+ years but now that he‚Äôs
coming after me he‚Äôs shown me the truth over and over and over again and
the truth is honestly really fucked up.

Dusty‚Äôs gang could be planning something yet again.. I think their main aim
is mind control however.

They‚Äôll like leave me these little ‚Äúwarnings‚Äù or ‚Äúsignals‚Äù like they‚Äôll
start flashing my cameras at me out of nowhere for instance when I get home
or they‚Äôll turn my vanity light on out of nowhere for me to discover when I
get home, etc, whenever they are either about to attack or when they have
just been in my house again doing something, etc. However, I don‚Äôt know who
is leaving these warnings or whether they are even warnings at all or
whether they are really just meant to scare me and/or get me out of my
house so that they can come grab evidence or so they can come set up their
real attack while I‚Äôm away, etc. Or if the ‚Äúwarnings‚Äù are really just their
latest way of letting me know who‚Äôs responsible again, as I‚Äôve previously
stated they love to let me know who‚Äôs responsible over and over again. It
may also just be them trying to mess with my head, idk. But most of them do
seem to correspond to some greater event and so I‚Äôve been treating them as
warnings up to this stage including just tonight. My hope is they are
indeed warnings being left by someone who actually somewhat cares about my
well being. It‚Äôs confusing as hell however.

My cameras don‚Äôt flash on their own like that without interference tho,
that‚Äôs how I could tell i needed to look into my cameras in the first place
when I discovered they were hacked this last time (and the time before
that) is cuz I knew how my cameras flash‚Äôs behave normally and they will
suddenly begin not behaving normally anymore; and my vanity light used to
remain off for years at a time‚ÄîI never turn that thing on. And yet, there
it is‚Äîon out of nowhere‚Äîand you have to deliberately turn that thing on
too. (The vanity light being turned on happened I think twice recently even
tho I turned it back off each time; the cameras flashing at me all oddly
like that has happened to me a dozen or so times over the last few months)

I don‚Äôt want to say this cuz I‚Äôll be giving the attackers critical feedback
but just know they‚Äôve been continuing to advance their microchip
capabilities. They seem to now be past the previous stage I described
previously. The previous stage lasted for about 1-2 weeks I‚Äôd say,
partially thanks to my repeated attempts at screwing up their data/blocking
it. What the next stage is, I still haven‚Äôt figured that part out yet.. (So
I don‚Äôt know how to try and block it) I‚Äôll just say that they might now be
capable of interfering with‚ÄîI can‚Äôt say it. I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt give them
this feedback. Just know they are continuing to unlock/decode my mind
(realistically speaking) and they can legit send and receive encoded
signals back to my brain now‚Äîand they will continue to progress until they
either take over my mind or until they are somehow stopped. They are legit
trying to hack my whole mind/my whole subconscious mind. Minds don‚Äôt have
firewalls either. From what I read all the mind control programs in the
sixties failed so hopefully you can have some solace in that. (Although the
AI of the sixties was nowhere near as close to where it‚Äôs at today, so I‚Äôm
not very comforted by that fact myself at this stage) This appears to be
yet another way my brother is trying to get me to not be considered a good
witness going forward it seems‚Äîat the very least. (Whether or not he will
ultimately succeed at taking over my mind like he did with all my other
devices, only time will tell‚ÄîI plan to do something drastically different
this time so I hopefully don‚Äôt end up with the same outcome. I hope he does
not succeed in taking over my mind tbh‚ÄîI hope somebody truly helps me with
Dusty before it gets to that point tbh‚Äîbecause I‚Äôm telling you right now
you don‚Äôt want to have dusty have full control over my mind‚Äîhe and his
co-hackers are honestly evil as hell‚Äîtrust me) If there were ever a time to
hurry tho, that time is now. I feel my brain is strong and the good in my
brain far outweighs any bad and I hope that means my brain will be heavily
resistant to anything my brother throws my way, or at very least I hope
I‚Äôll be able to rechannel any bad he sends my brain‚Äôs way back towards him
and use it to proceed with doing good, (By using it to encourage me to go
even harder at trying to nail the ultimate source of the evil once and
forall‚Äîthat is my brother Dusty‚Äîbut I‚Äôd prefer not to even let it
officially get to that stage if I can help it and I hope you will help me)
but yea, I guess we will just have to wait and see what happens.. I
wouldn‚Äôt leave it to chance if I were you though. I plan on suing Dusty and
getting the hell out of dodge, I just hope the police/fbi/nsa are working
on my brother themselves as well.. Feel free to hack me all you want btw,
it won‚Äôt make much of a difference to me and it won‚Äôt even feel like a
violation of privacy to me at this stage tbh. The best way to get to my
brother is by hacking me anyways.. (My computers/routers/cell phones and
any suspicious routers close by my house) Plus he‚Äôs never going to get off
my network and the surrounding area fully‚Äînot even if you hack me. Just be
sure to keep an eye out for signs of my brother's gang‚Äôs hacking while you
are in there please. You guys will know more about the technologies my
brother is using to hack me than I do‚Äîseems I suspect they are at least
partly your very own technologies. That‚Äôs got to be the best way to combat
situations like this. That way you can keep an eye on literally everything.
(Assuming you haven‚Äôt already done that) That‚Äôs one good thing about
hacking‚Äîeven the hackers can be hacked lol‚Äîand pretty easily too I would
imagine‚Äîjust pretend to be me lol. (When I‚Äôm close by myself so as to not
cause suspicions whereas they can also see my location in my house) These
hackers look into seemingly almost everything I do. I‚Äôve thought of trying
it myself sometime if I could be sneaky enough to be able to successfully
learn how to hack and quickly do so, but I doubt it. I‚Äôve tried canary
tokens previously but even then they control my freaking emails so that‚Äôs
no good to me either really. It would almost have to be someone else who
hacks them through me essentially.

No wonder my brother is into this kind of stuff. The father of LSD also
happened to be the ‚Äòpoisoner in chief‚Äô and the ‚Äúmind control expert‚Äù in the
‚ÄúMk Ultra‚Äù projects of the Cold War. My brother has been into LSD for some
time now. Those mind control projects have since been officially
discontinued supposedly‚Äîbut hackers have gotten their hands on them since..

As of January 26, 2022

Ultrasonic aging.
https://www.science20.com/scott\_beers/the\_acceleration\_of\_spirits\_aging\_using\_ultrasound-242874


I wonder if directed ultrasound in high doses has the same effect on the
human body as it does on alcohol. Dusty uses ultrasound on me, he uses
infrasound on me. He uses different variations of electromagnetic
frequencies and radiation on me. He uses all kinds of different poisons on
me. And everything in between. And he now does it to me daily. I have to
buy single use deodorant, single use body wash, single use toothpaste,
single use everything these days‚Äìand even still he‚Äôs still apparently
making me age prematurely using physics, etc. It‚Äôs just ridiculous tbh.

You would think I was his damn science project. But he‚Äôs doing it all with
ill intent and without my permission. And he fucking flaunts it to my face
afterwards continuously.

It‚Äôs scary. I wish someone would put an end to it once and for all. I
didn‚Äôt live a double life my whole life and become a hacking/gang
leader/mobster like my brother so I am admittedly at a disadvantage in all
this. If that means I‚Äôm now doomed to a life where Dusty is able to
completely walk all over me and fuck up my entire life, make me age all
prematurely, fuck up my brain and fuck up my teeth, etc, etc, etc‚Äìall to
try and save himself‚Äìthen that‚Äôs just completely messed up.

He shouldn‚Äôt be able to get away with all this just cuz he‚Äôs the most
ruthless/intelligent/technologically adept criminal around. If anything,
that should give you all that much more incentive to bring his crime spree
to an end however possible and as soon as possible I feel. Because
otherwise you are just going to end up with a bunch of people trying to
mimic his techniques and/or innocent people taking the fall for him and not
solving anything.

I think Dusty‚Äôs trying to make me crack or something to save himself. From
there he‚Äôd likely just do what he does now which is a combination of
gaslighting and manipulating others to get them to believe what he wants
them to believe. Then he‚Äôd be free to continue his rampage with a blank
slate essentially. Now I know what not to do at least..

All I know is I can‚Äôt stop Dusty by myself. My brother is a serious threat
to society. I wish a group of people who are as technologically adept as he
is in law enforcement would go after him tbh, while keeping in mind I‚Äôve
been trying to figure out how to stop his onslaughts against me myself and
while keeping in mind it‚Äôs not going to be easy. Try talking to someone
about all this who isn‚Äôt technologically inclined btw‚Äìit‚Äôs damn near
impossible tbh‚Äìand Dusty uses that to his advantage. Dusty‚Äôs not going to
stop just cuz I hire a lawyer who files a stalking injunction against him
either‚Äìhe‚Äôs not going to stop until he‚Äôs literally forced to‚Äìthat much he‚Äôs
made perfectly clear to me. (I can rule out the church of scientology at
this point I think)

At the end of the day nothing is black and white and nobody is perfect,
situations like this are extremely complex, but I‚Äôm telling you right now
on a level of overall threat to society Dusty arguably tops that list‚Äìjust
given his intelligence, his never-ending hate for even his own family and
their pets, his ongoing rampage, his ability to corrupt and manipulate
others, pit others against each other strategically, his ability to get
away with things, his gang‚Äôs insane hacking capabilities, his access to
advanced technology, his interest in nanotechnology, his gang‚Äôs insane
break-in capabilities, his gang‚Äôs tracking capabilities, their x-ray vision
capabilities, his weaponization of sound, his access to other resources and
specialists who do whatever the hell he wants all seemingly hired
anonymously, his use of anonymity in general, his ability to disguise his
true self to others when the police are looking into things, his ability to
use stereotypes to his advantage, his organized crime/gangster mentality,
his social engineering abilities, his ruthless tactics and witness
intimidation techniques, his use of information to drive all his attacks,
his premeditation capabilities, his insane math skills and AI expertise,
his infatuation with dark psychology, his deliberate false-flag operations,
his deliberate use of gaslighting, his ability to make people's deaths look
natural, his obsession with ‚Äúfall guys‚Äù, and his advanced futuristic
weaponry.

He literally kills/torments people using methods that likely have never
even been proven as murder weapons in court previously, just given their
newness, but they are in fact being used at least in part as murder weapons
by him indeed. (Fucked up murder/torture weapons at that‚Äìcancer and
premature aging and attempted brain takeovers are all fucked up ways to
kill somebody‚ÄìKarie looked like she was 100+ years old on her death bed
btw) He like does everything in the smartest way possible I swear.

I can‚Äôt wait until he actually gets caught and/or is actually held
accountable for once. I hope that day comes sooner than later.

As of January 27, 2022It‚Äôs Totally Russia

It‚Äôs totally Russia. My bro must have went and sought out their help when
he first realized he was busted. That might be about the only smart thing
my brother did. Everything else can be attributed to one or more foreign
super powers pretty much. But Dusty is totally now seemingly at least
cooperating with Russia and/or China.

I googled earlier ‚Äúhow to beat someone like russia‚Äù and it pulled back the
following article (
https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/07/how-you-can-fight-russias-plans-to-troll-americans.html)
then I started digging deeper into ‚Äúreflexive control theory‚Äù and I
realized again that what they are doing to me is all totally indicative of
someone like Russia and/or China cooperating alongside my brother.
(Poisonings and hacking and microchips and whatnot‚Äîthose are all things
Russia and China are notorious for)

Lookup ‚Äúreflexive control theory‚Äù for yourself. It‚Äôs very interesting. No
wonder my bro is so secretive these days.

Essentially what I suspect they are doing as of most recently is trying to
get me to believe all this is being done by anybody other than Russia,
hence why I keep going back and forth and back to them again. But I totally
caught them the other day actually reacting genuinely to what I was doing
at the time when I first accused these guys of being secret Russian agents.
In thinking back on it, after reading about ‚Äúreflexive control theory‚Äù, I
could totally tell the hackers were not just simply trying to mislead me
that time in their response to my writing too‚ÄîI essentially was able to
retroactively apply ‚Äúreflexive control theory‚Äù back at them in this case
given that was a genuine reaction when 3 different people logged in to view
what I was writing at the time‚Äîand wallah‚ÄîI swear to god it‚Äôs totally some
foreign adversary working alongside my brother somehow.

The key is to call out their manipulation apparently‚Äîin order to defeat
their reflexive control tactics. So that other people aren‚Äôt fooled.

I guess I would have done something similar as my brother had I actually
murdered someone myself in some parallel universe. (I.e. sought out help
from a foreign adversary) But I‚Äôm not a murderer myself‚Äîand I care about
more than just myself‚Äîthat‚Äôs the difference. (Plus I‚Äôm not a traitor
either) And so now it‚Äôs just like I somehow got to take down a whole super
power adversary just to get to my brother now to get all this harrassment
to stop pretty much‚Äîwhich is just total bs tbh.

I do strongly suspect our adversaries could be legit collaborating with
localized crime groups and using our own hackers against us‚Äîto try and
destabilize America in their attempt to defeat us from within. Plus, at
least in my view, the only way to defeat a super power in this day and age
is from within, without suffering irreparable damage yourself, when you
really sit down and think about it.

See this medium article I wrote for more details on my global politics
theory. It‚Äôs just a theory‚Äîtake it with a grain of salt. Still a wip. It
does at least somewhat line up with some recent events however..

https://link.medium.com/wsiruG3Ganb [Opinion]

My bro must have totally played these guys tho on how big an influencer I
really was lol‚Äîto get their support to help him try and discredit me in the
first place. (Or else he gerry rigged them somehow)

Regardless, what do I do now? Sue anonymous? (the hacking gang) Plus Dustin
Bay, Kyle French, Dusty‚Äôs roommate Erik, and Russia? China too? Lol‚Äîyea
right.

What I plan to do is continue to call them out. And pray our own military
is on top of this kind of thing assuming I am at least partially right in
all this.

I‚Äôll share some direct evidence on why I think Russia is at least partially
involved shortly I promise.

‚Äî------

They seemingly got off my computer?? Well maybe. They are using their
onsite screen viewer thing now instead. Let me see if my screen goes blue
when I restart..

Nope. It did something a little different that time where it normally goes
blue‚Äìthat was legit. Maybe just what it feels like with no malware, idk.
Hmmm..

Let me pull up some backups..

They completely reset everything just barely. Even my NAS device‚Äîas soon as
I plugged it in and had it connected to the internet for like 2 minutes it
reset on its own. I know cuz now my nas isn‚Äôt even broadcasting a hostname
or smb name anymore out of nowhere and it was broadcasting them just a
second ago.

It‚Äôs like they just sent out a command to all their devices to remove their
malware as soon as i connected them to the internet is what I‚Äôm gathering.

I got more devices I haven‚Äôt yet plugged in again however, and I‚Äôve got
plenty of backups in various places I think..

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trying to get my backups back up and running, I doubt they
touched everything I have tbh.

There‚Äôs quite a few ARQ backups but those ones don‚Äôt include all the root
system files.

Oh good‚Äìluckily my ARQ backups aren‚Äôt set to automatically pick up on the
root system files currently.. That‚Äôs a relief.

Here I found some untouched root image files on an external backup disk
with their malware on it I think for you, (when I did a manual backup to an
external hard drive to preserve it all previously) let me know if you want
them, they seem to want them back now themselves. I‚Äôll try and upload it to
s3 or something, well actually then they‚Äôll be able to tamper with the
drive while it‚Äôs plugged in to my computer themselves.

Anytime I plug in a new infected device it reinfects the whole network now
again lol. Wowa. Was that a setup?

My computer screen went blue again upon restart this last time now that I
plugged a bunch more stuff in just barely..

Yea they are back on again now.

I‚Äôll keep adding more stuff back onto my network tomorrow regardless
however, unless you don‚Äôt want me to..

This is kinda cool seeing all this advanced malware‚Äìhowever it sucks not
being able to do anything about it myself.. :/

If you want a hard drive or two containing i suspect their malware to
evaluate on your own time I can do that‚Äìif that works best for you. Sorry.
I originally thought this would be a good idea but maybe not so much. These
guys literally monitor and anticipate your guys' next moves‚Äîthey watch this
google drive file and everything else I do themselves too. Last thing I
want is for them to get access to your malware.. All they do is steal
everything from us anyways, all our trade secrets and whatnot‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I
never really liked Russia myself.

Shutting everything down now.. Let me know what if anything I need to do.

I‚Äôd start using their malware to go after them btw, that way you aren‚Äôt
risking or reluctant to use our own. Start doing what they are doing only
in Russia too. We need more public relations about this issue. If all our
rich people got involved just like all their oligarchs‚Äîthey would be
totally screwed. I guess that brings it back to what I said at the bottom
of the medium article tho. They are like opening a Pandora‚Äôs box that could
turn out extremely devastating for humanity going forward. (in my opinion)
But they are ruthless as hell and they go straight for the jugular‚Äîwhat the
hell else are we supposed to do?

Everything going on in Ukraine right now is likely just yet another
instance of them postering/trying to keep our eyes off of the ball/off of
their real plan. Their real plan likely entails lots of hacking,
manipulating key people, undermining, and defeating us from within. (at
least in my view)


This has got to be a foreign adversary I would think. Idk. It‚Äôs hard to say
forsure as just a regular civilian myself. But no gang I‚Äôve ever heard of
has this many advanced resources and technologies. They even do the thing
that Edward Snowden said was the most disturbing of all out of the NSA
capabilities he exposed‚Äîto me‚Äîa US citizen. But you would know better about
who they really are likely just based on my descriptions of their malware
than I do. I just wanted to try and make sure they didn‚Äôt completely ghost
me again and make me look like a fool by having you check on my network
only to find absolutely nothing. (If you even checked on my network)

I think I want to join the U.S. military cyber division. Then these guys
couldn‚Äôt touch me anymore lol. I would have a lot to learn if so though.
But I‚Äôd rather join our military than some foreign military that‚Äôs for
sure. It seems to me like we could honestly use some more programmers in
our military right about now too. I‚Äôd even take lower pay tbh. I‚Äôve been
thinking of joining the military or airforce or something just to get away
from these guys lately tbh. They are super annoying to say the least. They
always do shit like this and they are always super hard to catch just given
all their illegal advanced intel and all their corrupt resources seemingly
always on stand by‚Äîthey can remove evidence just like that‚Äîbefore the
police even arrive for instance.

If nothing else it‚Äôs good to know it‚Äôs not my own government doing all this
fucked up shit to me‚Äîthank you.


As of January 31, 2022

The problem I keep running into is that I essentially need a tool like
Darktrace or Cyberreason enterprise AI solution. But I‚Äôm only one
person‚Äìthey only make that stuff for like huge enterprises and it costs a
ton of money.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIpusuGIG\_A

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc32nUDyxaI

I looked into other ways to protect myself from an advanced persistent
threat, and I got two ideas. One is I literally need to automate my macs
deployment and write code allowing me to make them immutable. Meaning
essentially I‚Äôd make it so I could easily re-deploy the whole operating
system on them as much as multiple times per week if I had to. And then
just have it all programmed to where it won‚Äôt take me hours and hours each
time just to get back up to speed.

The other idea is just to buy yet another router, hopefully this next one
will be able to allow me to segregate my network a little better without
their interference but I honestly doubt it.

I really need to do something because if you look in this following video
of my aws account taken just tonight, you‚Äôll see they are actively scanning
my s3 everytime I login. S3 is where I store all my backups and whatnot.
Plus they are attempting to use my servers for malicious reasons. This is
why I say you‚Äôll never find their search history‚Äìbecause their search
history is likely spread across an entire botnet of devices. Even if you
find an ip, which I did as you‚Äôll see in the following video, the
likelihood of that ip being the attackers direct home ip is slim to none.
One of those could be their botnet server ip tho‚Äìbut even then they watch
everything I do so they could just change it.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w4hKO6JFN3Y2507AFlEOEU1mYsGdU3UM/view?usp=sharing


It‚Äôs so bs they can do all this messed up stuff to me and then delete all
my evidence across all my external hard drives, internal hard drives, and
cloud storage afterwards‚Äìdespite my best efforts to prevent that from
happening on all fronts. (And I‚Äôm no newb either, it‚Äôs just one can only do
so much against such a powerful adversary) But yea, their ability to
constantly be able to destroy any and all evidence I have on them puts me
at an even bigger disadvantage. I started creating a new cloud backup of
all my files using google‚Äôs cloud, and not only that, I started working on
a tool which will automatically tag all my security videos for me so I
don‚Äôt have to dig through literally days and days of footage just to look
for one or two videos I may have caught of these guys that might be of use
to me. So I can instead just do a search across all my various videos taken
across my various cameras for ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, etc, and I can just dig through
those. But after seeing how they are literally doing all this shit to my
accounts anytime I‚Äôm logged in to my accounts again tonight‚ÄìI think I just
need to focus on preserving what evidence I already have and the only way I
really know how to do that at this time is to log out of all my accounts
and to get away from technology entirely. (To leave my whole career
behind‚Äìwhich won‚Äôt be easy)

My mom used to actually care that Dusty was blocking me from making a
living. I guess I can see where she‚Äôs coming from now at least in part
though just given how not calling Dusty out at this point is probably a lot
safer than calling him out like I did originally. (I can see why she would
be fearful of him at this stage essentially) But keep in mind that I only
called him out originally cuz I suspected Dusty of trying to fill my
prescriptions to begin with, among everything else it reminded me of, and
therefore he was already coming after me before I ever even called him out
to begin with.

I still don‚Äôt get why Dusty is so evil towards me these days. He acts like
it‚Äôs no big deal if I die, but if that‚Äôs the case if it‚Äôs really no big
deal to die then why is he trying so damn hard to save himself? Of course
he denies all this and doesn‚Äôt listen and tries to discredit me. I do still
feel I could beat him in court however. Just by using his harsh denials
against him essentially. And comparing that to what a reasonable unbiased
person would think at any given time as the evidence I have obtained has
unfolded‚Äìand comparing it to how the average unbiased person would treat me
at the time. Most people didn‚Äôt call me crazy to my face when I showed them
the videos of the intruders in my house for instance, like Dusty did. And
on and on as the evidence kept piling up. Things like that will hopefully
show the jury Dusty most definitely has something to hide. (Keep in mind I
was at the height of my career before this all started in September‚Äìnow I
am faced with having to choose a new career entirely) Not to mention the
fact he used to not even deny any of it.

I suspect they keep re-hacking my car as if they are so scared I‚Äôm going to
get away from them if they don‚Äôt have eyes on me 24/7 or something.
(Meaning they seriously plan to follow me wherever I go) Everytime I go
into the dealership they have to reset it then it acts more normal for a
few days until they hack it again.

Lastly, I‚Äôm not right about everything‚ÄîI realize this‚Äîbut I am right about
the foundation of most of the things I allege in this document‚Äîincluding
the fact that my brother is indeed behind the people who have been coming
after me, he‚Äôs in on it himself, the fact that they have been coming after
me for some time now, Dusty has shown the ability to be able to stop it on
more than one occasion, and the fact that Dusty seemingly has
resources/technology at his disposal that only a powerful government could
realistically possess.

Like the facts I just stated are pretty clear I hope to everyone by now.
I‚Äôd do better if I could but I‚Äôm so outnumbered and they have such a
technological advantage. I might could lay it all out a little better and
follow up on some of the things I said I‚Äôd follow up on but that‚Äôs it.
(Like more evidence of Russia, etc)

Since I accused them of trying to destabilize the US I‚Äôve received
seemingly genuine positive feedback from the hackers that that is indeed
why they are backing my brother btw. They don‚Äôt like me talking crap on
Russia apparently either lol. I‚Äôm pretty good at seeing through people I‚Äôd
say‚Äîeven if my interactions with them are all digital in nature. I can
still figure out ways to ultimately see through them using reflexive
control tactics, etc, etc.

One thought I had since is maybe their malware goes blue like that
intentionally‚Äîbecause their real goal is seemingly to corrupt people and
terrorize people in our society strategically and with surgical precision
rather than just spy on ppl‚Äîwith the ultimate aim of manipulating our
country‚Äôs demise. (It‚Äôs not just Russia either, it‚Äôs also China, North
Korea, and Iran‚Äîthey are just secretive about their alliance kinda like my
brother and Russia are secretive about their alliance‚Äîit gives them an
strategic advantage essentially) I suspect they are even in the credit
beruaes systems now btw. They just use their access to only change up a few
db records at a time with the aim of quietly ‚Äúpersuading‚Äù certain key
individuals in their favor‚Äîso as to avoid raising any major alarms. But
yea, if the people they hacked didn‚Äôt even know the hackers were there then
what good would it even be to them?

I wrote another article under that same medium account you should check out
if you get a chance. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe only way to defeat a super power‚Äù or
something similar. In there you will find some more evidence of Russia too
btw‚Ä¶ (And their secret strategic alliances with other countries that I
happened to figure out first hand) I wrote that one before the insurrection
happened even.

I think dusty must have hacked me in 2019, found out I was onto Russia in
relation to my work, and when paired with all that was going on at the time
in our politics anyways‚Äîhe went and tattled on me to Russia to gain their
support so he could stay out of jail essentially. Something like that
anyway.. Reflexive control doesn‚Äôt work so well when you are using it to
see how someone responds to whether or not they are a murderer come to find
out lol. (Assuming they really are)

I‚Äôve been doing alright lately btw, figuring out how to hang in there for
the time being anyway.. The secret is I think nanotechnology paired with my
infrasound jammer and their somehow getting in my house constantly to keep
placing their nanotechnology in new locations that can bypass my latest
defenses. Once I figured that out then whenever I feel a sensation like
that at night I now know what to look to remove. Of course now I say that
who knows what they will come up with next. Their goal is to make me look
crazy after all. So it‚Äôs crucial to them that they are able to keep doing
so. (As if it‚Äôs normal for someone to just go completely insane like they
are trying to make me look to begin with anyways tho, I‚Äôve never heard of
that happening to anybody myself) What gang uses nanotechnology anyways? No
gang I‚Äôve ever heard of. Dusty‚Äôs totally a foreign agent advancing foreign
interests for his own gain nowadays. (I.e. he‚Äôs totally a traitor)

Dusty tries to paint me as a liberal these days to get an advantage over me
with the local authorities. (I‚Äôll show you shortly) All I‚Äôll say is I
didn‚Äôt even know where I stood on the political spectrum before Trump came
into office, I‚Äôve heard most ppl lie somewhere in the middle of the
spectrum anyways, I personally value our freedom, I feel we are stronger
together, I feel being honest is better than lying just to try and get a
leg up on someone around me, at least I‚Äôm honest, and lastly‚ÄîI‚Äôm actually
registered as Republican currently. Don‚Äôt let Dusty‚Äôs and his partner in
crime‚Äôs manipulation get to you. I am just an average citizen who happens
to have an evil brother and I‚Äôm trying to do the right thing for my
neighborhood, town, and country and for my family that‚Äôs it. Doing the
right thing is never easy. I honestly wish more people would stand up and
do the right thing themselves tbh‚Äîregardless of party. That‚Äôs all it would
take to bring this all to an end in my view. Even my mom said she found it
odd Dusty is acting all Republican lately btw.. (He used to be extremely
liberal to say the least, idk what to believe in regards to his political
affiliation anymore, but it really doesn‚Äôt matter in my view‚Äîthat‚Äôs the
whole problem in our country right now in my view‚Äîit just means our
adversaries manipulation is clearly working to further weaken us)

I suspect Dusty is trying to reprogram my memories with his microchip(s) by
demodulating and re-modulating the signals which form my dreams‚Äìin
particular dreams relating to my father‚Äôs death as of most recently‚Äìbut
they aren‚Äôt accurate representations of what happened. (Which I believe is
the whole point‚Äìto try and screw up my memory)

I‚Äôve been having a few different strange dreams lately. Some of which felt
like they were repeats and felt strangely fake, and repeat/fake dreams have
never happened to me before. (It makes sense seems how they have primarily
targeted me at nighttimes since the beginning so they likely have a lot of
data on my dreams, in addition to a lot of data of me typing/reading on my
computer)

This is what I didn‚Äôt want to say up above btw. Because it shows them they
are actually getting through to my dreams. If Dusty repeats it enough even
the best most resilient people are prone to eventually believe it.

All this is the real deal you guys. Dusty wouldn‚Äôt be doing all this to me
if I were wrong about him. It‚Äôs like reflexive control but to the
extreme‚Äìto the point where Dusty is still reacting or reflexing to what I
accused him of years ago. His reflexes are very genuine indeed. Don‚Äôt get
me wrong, I love my brother. I‚Äôm impressed with my brother‚Äôs capabilities
tbh. But I still don‚Äôt like what he is doing to me nor what he did to our
family‚ÄìI don‚Äôt like how he treats this whole world and all the people in it
as his personal ‚Äúplay thing‚Äù. I wish he would have just left me alone tbh.
He chose this path because deep down he‚Äôs into things like nanotechnology
and mind control himself‚Äìand deep down he enjoys causing others harm and
manipulating people‚Äìand because at the end of the day all Dusty really
cares about is Dusty.

‚Äî-------

These guys literally deliberately hack everybody around me. Including any
new contacts I have like when looking for a personal assistant or property
manager earlier to help me manage things when I move‚ÄìI could legit see them
messing around with my messages I just sent in the background. Editing my
messages I assume to try and manipulate the messages to include malicious
commands so that they can hack pretty much anyone I talk to. (Hence making
ppl fearful to talk to me‚Äìand making me fearful to try and talk to anybody)
How fucked up is that? They clearly have full intent to do this to me and
everyone around me until I am dead. But to be clear‚ÄìI‚Äôm not the one doing
it. I didn‚Äôt do anything to my brother to even deserve this. The blame
falls squarely on Dusty and his evil organized crime crew. (You know, the
ones who actually get joy out of causing harm to others and causing chaos
within our society)

My mom straight up failed with Dusty. Like straight up. I‚Äôm sorry mother
but holy crap‚Äìreign in your son already. Stop acting like you are in denial
about it. Your one son is completely and deliberately doing some of the
worst stuff imaginable to your other son and deliberately trying to make
your other son's life completely miserable in every possible way including
but not limited to making your other son completely lonely and completely
without any income whatsoever‚Äìall because your one son killed your other
sons fucking father and sister and your other son called him out on it‚Äìand
yet you still don‚Äôt even do a damn thing about it. Before long Dusty is
going to make it so I don‚Äôt even have any money left in my trust
whatsoever‚Äìmoney goes fast especially when you aren‚Äôt even bringing in any
income. Hence why I‚Äôm so confused how Dusty has been able to stay afloat
for so long without any income himself. (He owns his house outright thanks
to our father I guess but he had a similar commercial rental payment as me)

It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs made me lose my whole trust or anything YET‚Äìit‚Äôs just
the fact that I can see where this will lead if it is allowed to continue
unchecked. Dusty has damaged my trust already in just a few months‚Äìthat is
a fact. Think how much he could damage it if this is allowed to continue.

My personal plan to combat their latest abuses from a monetary angle is to
start producing youtube videos on frontend programming and to start
monetizing the videos I produce‚Äìsomething the hackers cannot stop me from
doing. Something I‚Äôve always wanted to do anyways and something I can do on
my own time without them being able to sabotage it‚Äìprovided enough effort
upfront on my part. Plus you can make a lot of money doing that‚Äìand it‚Äôs
all passive income as well. Meaning you make it once and it keeps earning
money for years afterwards. I already was a speaker at the largest frontend
programming conference in my domain recently anyways, which should
definitely help get me on the right path at least.

Dusty can put an end to all this at any fucking time and my mother damn
well knows it. Everybody knows Dusty is a serial killer now anyways‚Äìor at
very least knows to stay away from him just incase. (Everyone who isn‚Äôt
already corrupted by him I mean) Just do the right thing for a change
mother. If I heard someone who was a speaker at ng-conf recently all the
sudden begin to allege all this‚ÄìI‚Äôd stay the hell away from the person they
are allegeding all this against that‚Äôs for damn sure‚Äìregardless of any
smear campaigns being waged against them‚Äìeven considering just the evidence
and commentary I have actually managed to actually procure thus far in this
very folder. It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to understand that I didn‚Äôt
just go crazy out of nowhere. The probability of that being the case given
all the evidence I have managed to provide is literally slim to none at
this point‚Äìand even if that were somehow the case, I don‚Äôt see a lot of
support from her anyways. All I‚Äôve asked from her since this started was
just to freaking confront Dusty about it in a real way. And yet‚Äìnothing.
All that suggests and my mother‚Äôs actions themselves suggest my mother does
in fact know the truth she is just scared or something. Dusty had no reason
to hack me to begin with after all‚Äìunless he wanted to kill me or make my
life miserable or discredit me. And my mom damn well knows Dusty is
involved in hacking all of us including herself. The hacking goes hand in
hand with everything else I‚Äôve alleged. Only a hacker, or more accurately‚Äìa
group of multiple hackers paired with people on the ground‚Äìcould even do
the shit I am describing. It‚Äôs not rocket science to understand that‚Äìit‚Äôs
common sense with a sprinkle of dignity in my opinion. But my mom isn‚Äôt
tech savvy so I‚Äôll give her that.

But still it‚Äôs scary because Dusty is technically rigging it to make it so
even people like my own mother are technically at least somewhat complicit
in what he‚Äôs been doing to me‚Äìand therefore she is at least somewhat
complicit in whatever he plans to do to me next. (Not really but you get
what I‚Äôm saying I hope, silence is violence in this case) As I said to
Dusty in our last discussion‚ÄìI just wish he had never gotten so into
psychology. I wish he would find a new damn hobby. If my dad were around,
he‚Äôd do something about it‚Äìthat much I can guarantee you. Dusty is not just
going to stop with me either‚Äìthat I can also guarantee you. He enjoys it
too much. He enjoys ripping our family apart.

The hackers keep using everything I put in this file against me. Whereas I
can‚Äôt lie to the police‚ÄìI‚Äôm going to have to be more restrictive over what
I put in here going forward so as to avoid making my life more difficult
going forward. The hackers are essentially conditioning me not to continue
doing this in this way. Idk, it‚Äôs a tough call, because this is also I feel
what would ultimately help me win a court case against my brother if
nothing else. And also I don‚Äôt know how much they can gleen for themselves
without me even saying anything to begin with at this stage. (I suspect
quite a bit‚Äìand therefore it might not even matter) But all I know is they
keep taking anything I say here and adapting what they are doing to
essentially make my life even more difficult based on what I say in this
file. (i,e, the latest thing I said about my ecu resetting their tracking
capabilities‚Äìnow I‚Äôve got to figure out how to get around their suspected
latest tracking capabilities that likely isn‚Äôt reset with an ecu reset now,
the dream manipulation feedback I just told you‚ÄìI have no doubt that did
nothing but further encourage them is all, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc,
etc, etc, etc, etc).

It‚Äôs essentially the same thing I suspect Russia is doing with the Ukraine
matter. I don‚Äôt think Putin even knew what he was going to do to begin
with, he was essentially just looking for a reaction and based on that
reaction he is now deciding how to make his next move‚Äìwhich gives him an
advantage. (Reflexive control theory) It makes it so however we respond as
a country he can still make us look bad essentially‚ÄìI hate psychology and
manipulation tbh. I‚Äôm worried about our country as well tbh.

Just know the abuse/torture/harrassment being waged against me will most
definitely continue and could even get worse and worse until something is
ultimately done to stop it‚Äìregardless of whether I say anything about the
latest of what‚Äôs been going on and how I‚Äôve been combatting it or not.
That‚Äôs the overall theme of all this pretty much. But I also don‚Äôt want the
hackers to make me into some example of what will happen to you if you
don‚Äôt bow down to them either. (To be clear‚Äìthey didn‚Äôt even give me any
real choice‚ÄìI wasn‚Äôt going to dump turbo and my brother knew that‚Äìplus I‚Äôm
not evil by nature) The truth is what they fear the most is nobody bowing
down to them period‚Äìin which case their powers would be useless whereas
they simply cannot go after everyone and they would really be screwed if
everyone became fed up enough with all their shenanigans so as to cause
everyone to start trying to help end their crime spree. These guys strive
through terrorizing people I have found.

Just because someone robs a bank in broad daylight doesn‚Äôt make it
right‚Äìremember that.

I feel pretty confident in my conclusions at this point. I feel my
conclusions are accurate enough to withstand the test of time at this
point, more or less. (I feel I‚Äôm at least mostly right, it could just be
anonymous for instance but even if it‚Äôs only anonymous I guarantee you they
have russian members at the very least, etc)

But yea, people can make their own determinations based on everything I‚Äôve
laid out and come to their own conclusions. I honestly hope you will do so.
I‚Äôd like to know where if anywhere I‚Äôve gone wrong if so as well.

I will still update this when something major happens. One thing Dusty has
taught me throughout all of this is how powerful a tool psychology really
is and how scary it is when it is taken to the extremes and when it is used
by the wrong hands and when it is used to divide people.

I sometimes question whether Dusty really actually wants me to stick
around. (By constantly ensuring I know that if I leave I'll be followed, or
maybe he doesn‚Äôt care where i‚Äôm at‚Äìall he really cares about is knowing
where I end up‚Äìthe latter is probably more accurate tbh) But if that truly
is the case it means their little graphene microchip isn‚Äôt so good at
tracking me after all‚Äìwhich would be a plus.

Regardless, my passport should be here now in a week or two. I‚Äôd tell you
what I plan to do at that stage but I probably shouldn‚Äôt in order to retain
a competitive advantage. (Big brother taught me that one) With that said
though, I‚Äôll let you all know if they‚Äôve ever pushed me to the brink‚ÄìI
promise‚Äìit‚Äôs the least I could do. I really do appreciate all those who
have been willing to help.

Thank you for reading.

[**Correction‚Äìthe anonymous hacking gang is actually extremely liberal in
nature come to find out‚Äìthey care about things like african american rights
and they actually hacked the church of scientology at least in part due to
their gangstalking practices previously. While Dusty was extremely liberal
the whole time I knew him‚Äìhe hasn‚Äôt been acting that way recently. I
therefore don‚Äôt think all this has anything to do with anonymous anymore‚ÄìI
instead think it‚Äôs got to be some russian hacking gang/russian government
operation that Dusty is somehow a shot caller of. The russians do do things
like support local organized crime groups in order to further their causes
so that way it provides them with a buffer to hide their
involvement/funding/destabilizing activities]

I‚Äôm now thinking about trying to somehow get anonymous involved in helping
combat my brother and Russia lol‚Äìlike seriously‚Äìlook where being the good
guy has gotten me up to this point‚Äìit‚Äôs gotten me pretty much nowhere and
I‚Äôve had no ability to fight back other than by telling you all my story. I
suspect the hackers are even capable of censoring some of my latest
publications somehow as of most recently. (Yet another way hackers can mess
up your whole life and ensure the greater population never learns the truth
of what really happened)

I‚Äôll likely be taking off sooner than later btw, although my future is very
uncertain at this point. If I do actually manage to escape these guys‚Äô
grasp, you probably won‚Äôt hear much from me to avoid exposing my location.
If you do hear from me though, it will likely be in a highly encrypted and
difficult-to-track manner. (Deliberately) Conversely if they find me again,
I‚Äôll likely be back sooner than later. I just plan to go on vacation at
first anyhow, just to see what happens.

Anyways, what I wanted to say is if/when I die, I‚Äôd like to be buried in
Logan with Turbo‚Äôs ashes‚Äìregardless of where I reside at the time. Also, if
I do actually somehow manage to outlive Dusty or else outlast Dusty‚Äôs crime
spree‚ÄìI‚Äôd like someone to somehow inform me Dusty is no longer a threat so
that I can then decide whether or not to come back.

It takes extreme patience and determination to simply let Dusty do all this
to me and not do anything to him in return. But I do think it‚Äôs best if I
don‚Äôt sink to his level‚Äìthat could be exactly what they want from me.

I got my passport in the mail‚Äìnow I‚Äôve just got to guard it with my life
essentially..

I understand I need to surround myself with people but in order for me to
realistically do so I need to stop being harassed first and therefore I
feel I‚Äôll have a better chance at surrounding myself with people in a
natural setting if I‚Äôm able to get out of here first. Otherwise I‚Äôm not
going to be able to surround myself with anybody without being fearful of
them getting i my house while I‚Äôm gone again, etc, etc‚ÄìDusty also
conditions me to be scared to surround myself with other people by
poisoning me anytime I surround myself with other people essentially, etc.
Plus I already was pretty surrounded with people before all this harassment
started mind you. I really get the sense dusty doesn‚Äôt want me to go
anywhere tbh. And I get the sense Dusty likes me being under Paul for some
reason. At the end of the day, I‚Äôll never know just how wide Dusty‚Äôs
influence really is until I actually leave.

One of the worst things for Dusty at this point would be for me to escape
his influence after all‚Äîespecially if my life were then able to return back
to normal. Hence why Dusty never offers to help me in any real way
himself‚Äìeven though he‚Äôs the one who is arguably the most qualified person
who could possibly even help me with all the things I am currently facing.
(infrasound, ultrasound, emf, nanotechnology, hacking, electrical
engineering, ai, exploits, intrusion-detection, etc, etc) At the end of the
day Dusty doesn‚Äôt offer to help me in any real way because he is the one
who is ultimately doing all of this to me.

You try being put through all of this. What the hell would you do? All I
know is staying here seems like a recipe for disaster to me. The biggest
thing in computer security is physical access, if they can get physical
access then you are completely screwed and you will never be able to keep
them out. And I‚Äôm telling you they got physical access here whenever they
so choose. The video of multiple people in my house at the beginning of
this document proves that. They‚Äôve slowly gotten more and more access to my
home and more and more access to my devices over time. It all started with
‚Äúsocial engineering‚Äù followed by them just being outside my house at
nights, putting their hacking devices and their feathers and whatnot out
there, etc‚Äìnow it's gotten to the point where they are able to get inside
my house anytime they want pretty much. All because I didn‚Äôt get out of
here to begin with.

I‚Äôm sick of simply enduring all this harassment while they meanwhile
continue to obtain more and more control over me. I tried just enduring all
the hacking the first time around and look where that got me. I‚Äôm simply
not willing to make the same mistake now that they are clearly targeting my
brain itself. If they kill me while I‚Äôm gone‚Äîso be it. At least that way
they won‚Äôt succeed in mind control. Either way it doesn‚Äôt look too good for
our family in my view. If my mom is scared of Dusty being exposed for who
he really is‚Äìjust wait to see what happens if he is never exposed for who
he really is‚Äìthat‚Äôs all I can say.

[Reference goes here]

I got other things I‚Äôve put in place that have been helping slow down
Dusty‚Äôs latest tactics in the interim‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not enough‚Äìespecially given
how Dusty‚Äôs guys can and do continue to get physical access to my home on a
regular basis. I‚Äôve essentially now got two different ways I have to put in
place to combat both the infrasound and all the emf stuff
separately‚Äîcountering both all the infrasound and all the emf stuff are
both required just for me to be able to even get normal sleep anymore these
days. And even still that doesn‚Äôt help with their getting in my house
constantly whenever I leave and putting poison shit all over all my
bedding/within all my soaps and toothpastes and candies and whatever else I
can‚Äôt manage to fit on my person during the daytimes‚Äîthey literally still
break in and spread poison everywhere seemingly almost daily these days.
(Depending on how long I leave for during the days and whether it‚Äôs a
weekend or not‚Äîthey always step up their attacks against me on the weekends
even tho I don‚Äôt do shit on the weekends these days‚Äîit goes back to their
trying to paint a picture based on the police‚Äôs would be perceptions upon
finding me I think, etc)

What I want myself personally, seems how I am the one who is actually being
forced to endure all of this first-hand daily myself, is I want to get to a
place where I can live a completely normal life again without any
interference‚Äìlike I‚Äôve said to Dusty since the very beginning. (The only
problem is Dusty actually enjoys making people die using their worst fears,
including Karie which is when he first hinted at that fact to me; but for
me what I have consistently told him is I just want him to leave me the
hell alone‚Äìso what‚Äôs he do? He does the complete opposite of that. Never
tell him what you want or he‚Äôll do the opposite of what you want btw) Know
what else I want? To live until I‚Äôm 35. So yea, if dusty gets his way I‚Äôll
be dead or severely incapacitated before I‚Äôm 35. But yea, I‚Äôve endured all
Dusty‚Äôs harassment long enough. Dusty is not going to leave me alone if I
stay in northern Utah that‚Äôs for sure. Dusty simply has too many resources
at his disposal around here.

If you were monitoring Dusty‚Äôs computer right now‚ÄìI guarantee you‚Äôd see him
monitoring me. (Which is creepy but that‚Äôs what he does‚Äîspying like that is
a characteristic of a serial killer btw)

We have a real problem with hacking and our police‚Äôs inability to hack
suspected hackers to monitor them in my opinion. Most hackers aren‚Äôt going
to be communicating via the traditional sources and methods which normally
get people caught at the end of the day. You‚Äôd need to hack their devices
directly to even have a chance at catching them, and look at all their
encrypted messaging apps and command and control servers and whatnot. Until
then, what are regular citizens like me even supposed to do in this
situation? Learn how to hack back ourselves?

Just a quick reminder, Dusty wouldn‚Äôt even deny being a serial killer nor
being in a gang when asked repeatedly previously, he told me ‚Äúhe has his
own people now‚Äù after disowning all his friends and family previously,
Dusty was experimenting with dark psychology on his own family members
previously, (As evidenced by my other brother Mikey saying to Dusty at the
time ‚Äúyour little experiment needs to be over‚Äù--I think Dusty instead just
went the opposite way and took it all the way to attempted mind control
over me personally since then‚Äìwhile somehow convincing my mom otherwise
even after all Dusty had done to my mom back then), Dusty hacked and
deleted all his messages to all of us previously, etc, etc.

I think it‚Äôs time for me to do everything I can to escape Dusty‚Äôs influence
once and for all. And the only thing I havent tried yet is to get the fuck
away from him. At least then I‚Äôll be making him spend more money if he does
choose to continue to pursue me.

Nonetheless, some of the wisest, least-biased people I‚Äôve talked to who are
familiar with this whole subject have advised me to get the hell out of
here since the very beginning. I‚Äôve therefore been working on doing so for
some time now‚Äìthe only difference is now I finally just about can.

Still no hair regrowth on my legs btw.

I doubt you‚Äôd stick around if all this were being done to you daily. I need
to work on a legit exit strategy. One where everything will still be taken
care of and any communications with me will be fully encrypted, etc.

As of February 7, 2022

It really isn‚Äôt hard to find evidence of all Dusty‚Äôs manipulation/social
engineering. Isn‚Äôt it ironic he flipped from being liberal to acting more
conservative right before he started attacking me and Turbo again in 2021?
(I suspect in an attempt to sway the police in his favor using politics and
social engineering to his advantage‚Äìwhich is a pattern btw (i.e. he cheats
at literally everything he does these days I swear))

As I said before‚Äìat least I tell the truth and I don‚Äôt pretend to be
someone I‚Äôm not just to try and get a leg up on people.

Dusty is evil as hell you guys‚ÄìI‚Äôm telling you he really is evil. The true
Dusty is evil as hell. Like seriously. I could elaborate further but just
know his evil has no bounds.

In fact, Dusty‚Äôs whole identity these days can be explained by what he is
now doing to me. He started acting more conservative knowing he‚Äôd soon be
facing the police, right before coming after me and turbo again in July
2021. He started getting closer to my mom right around the same time he
started EMF-ing me in September 2021, knowing it would likely help him with
the police. Since then Dusty‚Äôs apparently even using Paul to do his taxes
again even though Paul apparently hadn‚Äôt even heard from Dusty for over a
year‚Äìright when I started looking into getting away from Paul myself. (I
assume again to help Dusty with the police, now that the police are
actually looking into all of this‚Äìunlike last year when Dusty was
completely MIA) Literally everything Dusty does these days can be explained
by the fact that Dusty‚Äôs social engineering society to try and get a leg up
on me‚Äìin his sick and twisted game of hunting me.

These are the kind of things that make all this just so obvious to me‚Äìin
addition to everything else he does to me daily. Dusty is willing to change
his whole identity however best suits him at any time in his pursuit of me
essentially. But deep down the only thing that doesn‚Äôt change about Dusty
is the fact that he is evil as hell, he actually enjoys manipulating people
and causing others pain, he doesn‚Äôt have a conscience, and he only truly
cares about himself. Everyone else is just a pawn in his sick and twisted
game essentially. He actually enjoys manipulating others to be ‚Äúin on it‚Äù,
either knowingly or unknowingly‚Äìor else somewhere in between. I suspect
that‚Äôs another way he corrupts people tbh, is by first social engineering
them to be ‚Äúin on‚Äù something like what he is doing to me to the police only
for the people he social engineered to later find out the truth..

Social engineering is the biggest most crucial aspect of hacking as well
btw. Therefore someone who is good at social engineering is also good at
hacking‚Äìand visa versa.

It actually all makes quite a bit of sense if you ask me‚Äìmore sense than
anything tbh.

I really think this is the closest I‚Äôve come yet to finding their command
and control server.

I say this because they took the machines those ips from yesterday were
pointing to down soon afterwards, or else they just changed ips/subnets
soon afterwards‚Äìand I mean they took it down or changed their ip addresses
regardless of what ip address i tried hitting it from. (So they didn‚Äôt just
block my one ip) They were connected to my laptop via udp on some strange
port, the same port as all these other strange ips. Plus when I nmap-d the
Russian/Portugese ips after finding them then it brought back a whole list
of similarly configured machines‚Äìand a ton of them‚Äìand I had never seen
that before. (I think it was some kind of botnet tbh) Before they switched
their ips I mean, before my nmaps started returning nothing on all hosts
and on all ports for those ips I had a chance to reach out to them and see
how their network was configured) I specifically targeted the Russian and
Portuguese ips because they showed up as being either home or remote
routers‚Äìnot servers. (Meaning I think they pointed to somebody‚Äôs home
address tbh) I think I caught them off guard in this instance tbh.

Russian router ip

46.242.8.144

Portuguese router ip

144.64.0.241

I know the Russians work with the portuguese from experience in working
with Russian/Portuguese contractors myself.


The following ips hitting my computer were all very strange indeed. They
were all hitting the same port on my computer. Like I said, I suspect the
above ips might have even been somebody‚Äôs home ips tbh, as shown in the
video I shared yesterday. How I got this was by doing what they call ‚ÄúArp
Poisoning‚Äù using a new program I found. Essentially you trick all the
devices on the network to think you are the router and so that all the
requests begin to go through you from all the devices on the network.
That‚Äôs also how they do man in the middle attacks I guess. It‚Äôs easy to do
once you know what program/command to run if you are on the same network
come to find out. In the following screenshot, 10.0.0.202 is actually my
local ip address to my computer that all those strange ips were funneling a
bunch of strange requests on a single port through.

Incase you didn‚Äôt notice I‚Äôve been learning to hack a little myself lately
just so I can get in the mindset of a hacker. Well I already know the
mindset of a hacker‚Äìthey literally always constantly look for how they can
exploit vulnerabilities in anything and everything. But all I‚Äôm saying is I
just figured the best way to know how to stop a hacker is if you are a
hacker yourself‚Äìthat‚Äôs the best way I can stay anonymous going forward
if/when I leave too. They call hacking for good, they call that a white-hat
hacker. Conversely, what these guys are doing is black-hat hacking‚Äìthey are
even darker than black-hat hackers I‚Äôd argue‚Äìmaybe even terrorists or
government-sponsored hackers. (Hired or directed by my brother somehow‚Äìsee
nearby picture for more info on the different types of hackers) But yea, I
think my plan of learning hacking is already paying dividends tbh..


I also verified that those ips weren‚Äôt just from a proxy server either.
Like I said I think I caught at least a few of them off guard in this
instance. Too bad they already changed their ips tho..

Again all this happened yesterday, February 7th, 2022, during the
afternoonish. Here‚Äôs more on all the info I gathered.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D3WorsljIF8brX4bx2hk1rmPjRIFJUCZ?usp=sharing

I still have more I‚Äôve been meaning to share with you in terms of Russia
too. Essentially they started posting comments on one of my blogs causing
it to email me at key times when they knew I would see the emails,
especially right around the time they were trying to frame me when I went
and got my lexus key signature changed, most the comments they would post
were in Russian, but one of the comments stood out because the it was all
russian besides the name of the email and the name of the email address
happened to correspond to the name of one of my sister‚Äôs daughters. As if
they were saying they might go after her next or something. That‚Äôs how I
took it at the time anyways‚Äìbut I didn‚Äôt want to over-react either.
Regardless, I think I still got all the logs for that, I‚Äôll share those
with you when I get the chance. I got a ton of stuff tbh, it just takes
time digging through it all.

For instance, I am getting close on finishing off my AI-driven security
video categorizer too‚Äìbut the closer i get to finishing it‚Äìthe harder they
make it for me to finish uploading the remaining hidden camera videos and
whatnot essentially. Because they know as well as I do that there could
very well be at least one video in all my various hidden camera footage
that captured one of them in my house‚Äìit‚Äôs just a matter of indexing it all
and finding it among all my video camera footages, hidden video camera
footages, etc, etc‚Äìwithout them destroying the evidence first like they
love to do..

Regardless, my brother hints at knowing way too much about all this to not
be part of it‚Äîhe flaunts at it way too much, a lot of times these guys will
even do shit to me right after having spoken to my brother for instance,
things that directly correspond to whatever I just spoke to my brother
about, as if to send me a signal that my brother is indeed the one behind
it. Plus my brother himself acts like he‚Äôs in on it just in general, he‚Äôs
the only one who might possibly want me dead and spend this much time and
effort in trying to kill me, and at the end of the day Dusty has been the
only one who has been capable of getting them to actually stop; after
asking me what I wanted over sms right after the Eagles‚Äô incident, etc. I
get the sense Dusty is a hacker too but I also get the sense that it‚Äôs not
just him‚Äìthat much is for certain. I honestly don‚Äôt know how much of it is
Dusty himself and how much of it is just shared information given to Dusty.
Therefore I can‚Äôt tell whether he just hired them or not. And I don‚Äôt
understand why Dusty would be working directly alongside what I suspect to
be Russian government affiliated hackers. I know he wants me dead but why
would they work with him to kill me? All I know is it‚Äôs extremely unjust
and it‚Äôs completely and totally fucked up‚Äìthat‚Äôs all I know for sure. I
wish someone would stand up to my brother and get him to call it off.
Nobody deserves to be put through all of this‚ÄìI don‚Äôt care wtf they may
think I did to them‚Äìit‚Äôs fucked up.

All I‚Äôm saying is if my bro really is working with Russians to kill me as I
now suspect, then what the hell am I supposed to do? This could get out of
hand real quick especially if they start doing this to others too.

[Opinion]

Dusty even said something to me like the first week or two after they first
started emf-ing me about how that was quick or something, asking me how I
did that. (Implying he/they already got caught or something) Which just
makes me wonder, like what if they already did catch him/them doing all
this to me but it was just deemed top secret and/or a matter of national
security or something so there‚Äôs nothing they could really even do? That
seems like something my brother would do is set himself up to be almost
impossible to stop too. Idk, it‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm still confused about that
Joseph Escobar cop I initially reported all the emf stuff to. I don‚Äôt know
if he was from the fbi or what.

You would think if they did already catch them and deemed it to be Russia
tho then they could still do something about at least some of this
regardless tho. Dusty saying that could have just been another episode of
my brother social engineering me knowing I may bring it up later, and of
him rubbing it in my face as well, idk, it‚Äôs hard to say forsure. If it
were up to me I‚Äôd at least try and pursue any foreign agents/persons who
hired the Russians who actually physically reside here in the states who
are also responsible as well tho. (Persons like my brother and Kyle French,
etc‚Äîcuz without them‚Äînone of this would be possible)

It‚Äôs so weird thinking that some foreign country might could actually get
away with brutally but slowly killing someone right in front of everyone
when we aren‚Äôt even officially at war to begin with. And even stranger
still is that unlucky person they are brutally and slowly killing could be
me‚Äînot to mention the fact that the person who had to have initiated all of
this if so would have had to have been my very own brother‚Äîall to cover for
his past murders I suspect.

Surely there‚Äôs got to be some way for me to live a full life even still
tho‚Äîregardless of how small a probability it really is.

If that really is the truth‚Äîall I ask is you please don‚Äôt forget about me
and you try and help me make it through‚Äîbecause this is honestly tantamount
to torture. My own witts are the only thing that are seemingly going to
help me make it through. (Through my own witts I‚Äôm able to decrease the
amount of torture I have to endure‚Äîbut not by much given how it‚Äôs such an
uneven match to begin with)

P.s. Please don‚Äôt let this latest section dissuade you, it‚Äôs just hard not
knowing the truth. It‚Äôs easy to think of the worst case scenario sometimes.
All this is key for everyone to make up their own determinations too.

If that is true, Russia has effectively done what they do to all our local
businesses, etc, but to our country as a whole and in a slightly different
manner, by making it a conflict of interest for the government to even come
forward to the public with info like this. (I.e. to come forward with the
potential that Russians could be putting microchips in some of our vaccines
which would likely scare the hell out of everyone and could potentially
cause a ton of damage to our country as a whole) If true, that would fit
the exact pattern of what these guys seemingly always do. If nothing else,
what I‚Äôve learned from all of it first hand is it‚Äôs seemingly probably best
to just bite the bullet and take the heat sooner than later and get
Russians out of the picture because otherwise they will ultimately
completely consume and corrupt you. (If you get what I‚Äôm saying, they do
the same thing with their hacking of businesses exploiting a weakness in
capitalism, if the businesses don‚Äôt report it and take the hit immediately
then the Russians ultimately end up owning them to a certain degree from
that point going forward) I learned this at Utah state university working
in the conflict of interest office. Those guys hated Russia and China, etc.
In retrospect, I‚Äôm rather impressed by those IT guys working there tbh.
Just think if Russia managed to corrupt entire universities. (They probably
already have tbh) We need to figure out a way to exploit a similar weakness
in socialism is what it ultimately comes down to.

Lesson - RF/Waves/Hacking[image: Diagram Description automatically
generated with medium confidence]

So I messed up, I‚Äôve been being forced to learn all this stuff about all
this various physics and hacking and whatnot lately just to try and protect
myself from all the electronic harassment and I never took the time to
break it all down for you all.

Fundamentally all you need to know is ANY type of wave can be used to carry
information. And if you are able to monitor those waves and decode their
meaning then you can begin to crack the information contained therein and
you can begin to reproduce that functionality/behavior by recreating
similar waves via external manipulation yourself essentially. (Including
car remote waves, security system waves, wifi, even brain waves)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RipwqJG50c

The electromagnetic spectrum covers everything from different kinds of
radio waves all the way to high intensity light/energy waves or gama waves.
When you think of radio waves you might think of AM/FM radio, there are ton
of different frequencies/patterns or modulations of radio beyond just AM/FM
radio btw, just know that all radio waves themselves can be encoded or
interpreted to contain specific information and are used for a whole ton of
different uses these days. When you think of light waves you might think of
x-rays or even fiber optic internet, the x-rays of which we are able to
gather information from using a specialized x-ray reader after the x-rays
have passed through our bodies and the fiber optic internet acts as a
direct carrier of information itself. (By encoding different meaning into
different patterns of light essentially)

RF stands for radio frequency‚Äìit‚Äôs a type of wavelength. A bunch of stuff
emits RF waves‚Äìbut that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be misused. For instance,
what happens when you click the unlock button on your key remote to your
car? What happens is it emits a certain frequency of radio waves in a
specific pattern or modulation, and that radio frequency pattern emitted
contains specific information which your car‚Äôs receiver then receives and
uses to allow you to unlock your car from a distance essentially. Same kind
of concept for wifi, most people have heard of the difference between 2.4g
and 5g wifi, which are just different radio frequencies that both
fundamentally allow you to use the internet wirelessly. 5g is a shorter
wavelength and is therefore faster but it is more easily disrupted by
things in the environment and conversely 2.4g has an easier time getting
around things in the environment because the wavelength is longer but it is
slower essentially; the same goes for 3g/4g/5g cell phone networks. These
days everything is controlled wirelessly through these various
electromagnetic waves. Sound waves are only beginning to be explored.


The significance of this is not too long ago presenters started showing off
various forms of RF spectrum monitoring devices at DefCon and other hacking
conferences; Defcon is like the leading hacker conference in the US. This
is significant because if you are able to monitor various types of radio
frequencies being put out at any given location and at any given time,
using monitoring devices that can be even placed across the road somewhere,
then you are then able to also begin to analyze, manipulate, and even hack
those radio frequencies to work for you‚Äìassuming your monitoring device is
also capable of emitting these different radio frequencies across the
spectrum. That, my friends is called a ‚Äúsoftware defined radio‚Äù. Hacking RF
has been all over the hacking conferences over the last few years, and that
is significant because it means hackers are getting more experience in
hacking/decoding/encoding various types of otherwise unknown
electromagnetic frequencies/signals.


For instance, there are actually multiple ways to hack some of the newest
car‚Äôs remote control unlock buttons. One way has to do with jamming. You
jam a radio frequency closeby the known frequency that the remote unlock
button emits on and then you monitor the actual radio spectrum for when
somebody actually pushes their unlock button. When somebody clicks their
unlock button, their car‚Äôs receiver is overloaded with the jamming that is
taking place on a nearby frequency and therefore the car won‚Äôt unlock for
them; however, the hacker has just captured your unique key‚Äôs radio
emission. What happens when your car doesn‚Äôt unlock the first time btw?
That‚Äôs right, you then push the button again. What a hacker is then able to
do is actually capture the second and third and fourth emissions as well
and then just simply re-emit the first one, which unlocks your vehicle for
you but it leaves the hacker with one or more valid replays they can then
use to subsequently unlock your car with while you are away. (See this
youtube video for a better explanation of hacking RF frequencies, this is
just one example of many: https://youtu.be/1RipwqJG50c?t=1638 )

See also how he hacks a garage door opener in something like 3 seconds:
https://youtu.be/1RipwqJG50c?t=1021

Another way hackers can hack your key is by simply capturing the signature
of the radio signal emitted whenever you click the unlock button over a
period of time and then they can use all that aggregate data to begin to
crack the underlying secret ‚Äúcode‚Äù or ‚Äúkey‚Äù or ‚Äúsignature‚Äù that is used to
encrypt all the subsequent keypresses, the ‚Äúsecret key‚Äù that is shared
between both your key remote and your vehicle. This
‚Äúaggregating/analyzing/cracking‚Äù technique would ultimately allow the
hacker to unlock or lock your car whenever they wanted without even needing
to replay anything that was previously captured. At that point the hackers
are your key essentially‚Äìbecause they are using the same algorithm to
create the unlock patterns. And that‚Äôs even considering all the latest and
greatest security features that have been put in place as of today and
that‚Äôs specifically talking about just car remotes‚Äìthis applies to way more
than just car remotes btw)

In the recent past our various car remotes would just push out the
information without any encryption whatsoever‚Äìleaving cars completely
vulnerable to abuse upon a hacker doing a single monitoring session. (i.e.
previously all the hacker would have to do is monitor your pushing your
remote unlock button once and then they could unlock your car as many times
as they wanted simply by replaying that command over and over again because
the radio emissions weren‚Äôt even encrypted‚Äìbut even now a hacker can crack
any encryption given enough monitoring is what I‚Äôm saying)

What I just referred to has all sorts of different consequences in our
current daily life‚Äìespecially for me given the threat I am facing and all
their constant hacking/monitoring. For instance, how do you think it works
when you arm or disarm an alarm system in your home these days? Most alarm
systems aren‚Äôt hard wired these days but are instead set up to work
wirelessly. Lets take ‚ÄúSimply Safe‚Äù alarm systems for example. Simply Safe
alarm systems use the same strategy to communicate among their various
devices as the car remotes described above, only they use their own unique
radio frequency/pattern/modulation/encryption, in order to get things like
the keypad to communicate back to the basestation to arm or disarm the
system for instance. Therefore even alarm systems are vulnerable to the
same attack as a car remote now thanks to software defined radio and the
potential of hackers monitoring the radio spectrum. Simply Safe used to
never even encrypt their devices' communications either btw, before their
latest model came out. (‚Äã‚Äãhttps://www.nimblefreelancer.com/simplisafe-hack/
) But like I said, even with encryption‚Äìa hacker with a software defined
radio can still bypass it after enough monitoring even if it is encrypted.
(The same is true with our brains btw)

This same concept of information being carried in various forms of waves
have been applied to both light and sound waves as well. Light waves can be
directly encoded to contain specific information (like is the case with
fiber-optic internet) or we can derive information from any variances in
energy by reading the results of similar light waves that were emitted
after having passed through something. (like is the case with an x-ray)
Different frequencies of light waves is what carries the information in the
first case. And any changes or diffraction in similar light waves is what
we gleen information from in the second case.

Sound waves also can be either encoded to contain specific information
directly upon emission or else can be used in something like an ultrasound
to look for any variances after passing through or bouncing off something.
(like is the case in ultrasound/echo-location)

Technically any type of wave can be used in this way essentially‚Äìeither
directly by encoding different values into different
variations/frequencies/patterns of waves upon emission or else indirectly
by evaluating how similar waves may change after going through a given
substance, etc. And given some of the latest hacking technology trends, I
think it‚Äôs safe to say hackers are getting better at encoding and decoding
various otherwise unknown signals through simple monitoring.

Therefore, these same concepts can be applied to our bodies/minds. Assuming
you are able to monitor the brain while the subject is performing a certain
activity in isolation, then you could also recreate those same signals in
the brain via external manipulation‚Äìjust like with the RF hacks described
above.



[Elaborate here]


One takeaway is this is all public information. It‚Äôs possible this is not a
foreign government after me after all. (All I know for a fact is my brother
is definitely involved) Advanced persistent threats are normally only done
by hostile foreign governments‚Äìand what they are doing to me can be
characterized as an advanced persistent threat. (An advanced persistent
threat is essentially the hacking against a single group, organization, or
individual that persists over time and never stops essentially‚Äìfor
years‚Äìit‚Äôs like what China and Russia were doing to Utah State University
when I worked their essentially‚Äìthey were constantly trying to break in any
way they could‚Äìonly in my case they have already broken in they just
continually try to hack me and my surroundings more and more and more,
etc..)

Todo: Talk about how I have managed to be able to get some better sleep at
nights lately through advancing my knowledge on these subjects. (By using
infrasound and emf countermeasures, in addition to doing my best at keeping
them out of my house physically with these things in mind, etc, etc)

Todo: Talk about graphene and its importance in nanotechnology and in
future technologies.

Todo: Talk about and provide examples of what hacks/vulnerabilities they
are using. Elaborate on everything I‚Äôve learned in terms of hacking.


 -

 They are using some variation of this remote exploit as one of their
 main hacking initial infection mechanisms: (They automatically hack
 everything with wifi on any given network whenever a single hacked device
 connects to the same network essentially)
 -

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDk2RId8LFo


Todo: Talk about latest patterns/behaviors of mine they‚Äôve been targeting
and trying to decode. And how they try to use them to disturb me at
nighttimes.

Todo: Talk about how the brain cannot be programmed‚Äìit can only be trained.
It‚Äôs a neural network after all.

Todo: Talk about infrasound and how it is used to control the body's organs.

Todo: Talk about my video tagging efforts and their obstruction efforts.

Penetration testing - This is what they are doing to me‚Äìonly I didn‚Äôt hire
them to do it: (What they are doing to me is the real deal)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsVtHqICeKE

I got one of these Quwave devices, which genuinely helped combat some of
their RF/EMF torture and helped me sleep. (https://quwave.com/defender.html)
Since they found out I got that they broke in and somehow disabled it even
though the light still blinks like it‚Äôs on. (Like I have a reader too and
it stopped emitting traceable signals after they broke in and disabled it,
leading to shitty sleep the last few nights) I just got my new one today,
and this one I plan to keep on me at all times. In addition, I‚Äôve
counteracted all their infrasound stuff by emitting my own infrasound as
stated previously. And I‚Äôm combating all their constant break-ins by
getting a new security system and trying to ensure they have a hard time
hacking it through all the knowledge I‚Äôve learned over time.

I swear they even have like different specialists in all different fields.
They have electrical engineer specialists, nano-technology specialists,
hardware specialists, break-in/lock picking specialists, and hacking
specialists.

Etc.

To be continued..

I just wanted to show you guys this stuff is indeed possible and it is
actually popular in the hacking community at this time.

As of February 15, 2022

I had a real dream last night thanks to my new untampered with
anti-mind-control uwave device and my father was there to comfort me in it.

I am a gibbons. Dusty is fucking with the wrong person. Dusty is not a
fucking gibbons. My dad is rooting for me. And dusty is just bitter about
the fact that he was not given the gibbons last name when he was born‚Äîdusty
even threw a fit about it to my mom previously around the time he first
started acting out in 2019.

My newly functional anti-mind-control device also helped me fall asleep
easier and sleep a lot less long last night‚Äîjust like I used to‚Äîimagine
that. It‚Äôs insane what energy medicine can do. (In this case it mainly just
serves to block all the mind control frequencies but still)

There is most definitely more to life after death than whatever the fuck
dusty thinks there is. Dusty is fucked at the end of the day‚Äîregardless of
what happens here. He needs to be put in jail tbh. And I say that with
utmost sincerity. He is extremely dangerous‚Äîparticularly to his own family
members whereas that seems to be his overall pattern.

Dusty just did one of his anonymous calls to my phone trying to intimidate
me again‚Äîas I typed this. Again showing it is indeed harassment and dusty
indeed needs to be put in jail.

I‚Äôm pretty sure dusty works during the day times and his roommate Eric and
that Kyle French guy work at night times. I suspect Eric and Kyle might
even be related or otherwise affiliated tbh. By works I mean they take
turns hacking/harassing/monitoring me.

Dusty must pay them with all his dark web money he‚Äôs earned over the years.
I‚Äôm telling you if you just arrest Dusty then this would all be over
with‚Äîregardless of who all he‚Äôs working with. Dusty is the source of the
problem and that‚Äôs a fact. He‚Äôs terrorizing all of Logan just to get back
at my father‚Äîand my father died 12 years ago now. That‚Äôs how fucked up in
the head dusty is. Everything that happened even years ago is therefore
still extremely relevant in this case because that‚Äôs how dusty thinks. He
never forgives anything. He spends his whole life pissed off about things
like that‚Äîthings that most normal people wouldn‚Äôt even bother getting
pissed about. And yet Dusty devotes his whole life to it.

It‚Äôs a fact that most people don‚Äôt expect something bad to happen until it
happens‚Äîas stated in that penetration testing video I referenced above.
Most people innately think all people are good‚Äîuntil something bad
happens‚Äîthat‚Äôs the essence of what social engineering exploits. That‚Äôs the
whole reason people hire penetration testers to begin with‚Äîis to wake
people up. But this is no penetration test‚Äîevil is indeed very real and my
brother is indeed extremely evil.

Dusty is not going to take over my mind anytime soon but the best way to
ensure he doesn‚Äôt is to arrest him.


As of February 22, 2022

I need to make a clarification. While the attackers aren‚Äôt able to
reprogram my brain which is a neural network, as stated previously, what
they are able to do is take control of my unconscious mind, come to find
out. (Meaning they are able to control me when I‚Äôm asleep on a higher level
than the neural network using electrical signals as input) They are able to
make me ‚Äúsleep walk‚Äù essentially. They started targeting me with a new
technology the night before last. It felt like they were scanning the room
using some new more precise directed sound wave scanning technology, a
newer more advanced and more precise version of what they have used on me
previously. (It was coming from the North, it was likely another mobile car
unit parked somewhere outside this time) What they were doing was literally
like a 3d survey of 3d space scanning one axial after another to form a 3d
model of my immediate surroundings. I specifically recall it moving my pant
legs whenever it would hit my legs. I also specifically recall every time
I‚Äôd move it would seemingly start over again, and rescan my immediate
surroundings over and over again in real-time, as if it were automated or
something. I tried my best to block it out as best I could before falling
asleep but what I‚Äôve learned at the end of the day is there really is no
blocking sound, they always seem to be able to find a way to get enough
sound in to be able to cause me to disturb my surroundings enough while I‚Äôm
asleep to be able to then have unfettered access to me. I have been
learning a ton about electro-magnetism lately myself and how electricity
going through a wire can generate its own magnetic field. I‚Äôve been
learning about electromagnetism lately primarily because electromagnetism
in the form of an EMP could be the key to disabling any unwanted
electronics that may be present in my ear without hurting me. [To be clear
I‚Äôm not stupid however, I‚Äôm very careful with everything these days‚Äìplease
don‚Äôt allow the attackers to use this or anything else I do to try and stop
this onslaught against me as a pretext for legitimizing yet another attack
against me. It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to learn about various
electronics and how they work‚ÄìI‚Äôm very careful in regards to what I do
given how the people attacking me have tried to set up numerous different
pretexts prior to now for my demise already] I suspect their microchip is
likely controlled using ultrasound btw, rather than RF, but I‚Äôm still
figuring that part out. They‚Äôve indicated to me their microchip is made of
graphene as well, which is a super new nanotechnology material, otherwise
I‚Äôd just take a normal magnet to it. Anyways, long story short, I had my
immediate surroundings in a very particular placement prior to going to
sleep the night before last when they started using that new technology on
me. And when I eventually woke up‚Äìeverything was completely out of place in
a way that would be hard to explain from my tossing and turning alone while
I slept. It was highly disturbing tbh. At first I questioned whether maybe
their new technology they used kept me asleep while someone got in and
messed with me somehow during my sleep or something. But then I ultimately
realized after checking on all my security measures I put in place, etc,
that someone did mess with me during my sleep‚Äìhowever they didn‚Äôt get in my
house to do it. (I.e. instead they are seemingly gaining more and more
control of my unconscious mind and they are able to mess with me during my
sleep from afar to a certain degree‚Äìthey are able to make me mess with me
during my sleep from afar without me even realizing it afterwards
essentially)

The extent to which they can control my conscious mind is very limited, as
stated previously. They can record signals of my brain while monitoring me
doing something in isolation and essentially replay those same signals
later to try and disturb me later, etc. However, conversely‚Äìthe extent to
which they can control my unconscious mind appears to be far greater than
that of my conscious mind. It has become a race to figure out a way to
disable their microchip before they are able to fully control my
unconscious mind, for reasons you can probably imagine.

As for where I‚Äôm at in my plan described previously, essentially I‚Äôm on a
leave of absence from work currently based on notes from my doctor. The
notes from my doctor specifically say this condition is not
‚Äúterminal‚Äù--meaning I didn‚Äôt all the sudden go crazy. I‚Äôm still advised to
see a counselor just to help deal with the PTSD and to help cope with all
the ongoing abuse however.

My doctor originally wrote his doctor‚Äôs notes such that I could return to
work on a flexible schedule, because at the end of the day I‚Äôm still just
as capable of doing everything I did previously beyond the fact that I have
a group of people actively interfering and actively sabotaging me.
Therefore a flexible schedule made the most sense because otherwise the
attackers could just go harder on me on any given night before I was
supposed to work, (like they ultimately ended up doing) and cause me to
miss any designated schedule. However Rent Dynamics came back after that
note and said they didn‚Äôt agree to me working a flexible schedule given the
nature of my job and being a team lead. So my doctor had to write a new
note with a designated part time schedule for me to return to work instead.
And the weekend before I was supposed to return to work with a part-time
designated schedule is when the attackers stepped up their attacks against
me to the point where I no longer felt confident I could block their
attacks to the point where they could no longer interfere with me during my
sleep and therefore I could no longer feel confident in returning to work.
So I ended up not going back to work and instead getting another extension
from my doctor at that time.

One of the main things I‚Äôve been working on is trying to figure out how I
can fund my way out of here. Especially seems how, as stated previously,
I‚Äôm simply too hacked to be able to make any true progress in keeping them
out as it sits currently. Any new security system I get ends up being
hacked while it‚Äôs still in setup mode. Any device I reset ends up getting
rehacked within days. The attackers simply have too many ways of getting
in, too many ways of monitoring everything I do, too many ways of spying on
my keypresses and on my screen using electromagnetism, etc, and they‚Äôve
simply already rigged my house such that it is literally impossible for me
to keep them out of here at this point. And whereas physical access is king
in terms of hacking ability, that is and has been the biggest battle I‚Äôve
been raging in general daily‚Äìis keeping them out of my house and taking
back my devices so that I can begin to do other stuff confidently. Moral of
the story is it is absolutely key for me to start fresh someplace new and
take all the lessons I‚Äôve learned here and apply them to a fresh restart
elsewhere, where they won‚Äôt already have all these different mechanisms in
place to bypass all my different security mechanisms and to spy on me, and
ideally where they don‚Äôt even know where I am located.

However there are two main things that are blocking me from moving
someplace else at this time:

The first is funding. I really don‚Äôt want to drain my trust if I can help
it. I have a ton of equity in my house so I‚Äôm hoping to avoid draining my
trust which is profitable by itself and instead pull from the equity in my
house. Now there‚Äôs two ways I can pull from the equity in my house, either
by selling it outright or by refinancing it. I‚Äôve been leaning towards the
latter because what I always planned to do when i left here was to rent my
house out when I eventually moved anyways, thereby continuing my estate how
I have been up to this point, keeping my same worth, and if anything just
having someone else pay down my mortgage for me. I don‚Äôt want to allow
these guys to completely fuck up all my plans in life. However with that
said, what they have managed to be able to do is make it a lot more
difficult to operate according to plan. It turns out it is a lot harder to
refinance my home when I am on a leave of absence from work. Currently the
plan with the refinancing is to wait until the beginning of March to begin
the refinance process, which will take ~30 days in itself, so that way the
creditors will be more at peace lending to me given how I‚Äôll then be slated
to return to work within ~30 days time. Meaning I had to wait to refinance
my house until I was close to returning to work. But then again Rent
Dynamics wants me to return to work once all this is resolved, and this
isn‚Äôt even going to have a chance at all being resolved until I move and
get away from these guys, and I can‚Äôt really even move until I have the
money to fund my move, and I won‚Äôt really have the money to move until I
refinance or sell my house. Worst case I guess I‚Äôll just have to sell my
house. But time is of the essence because every day is a constant battle
with these guys. I‚Äôm constantly having to reset different devices and
implement new strategies to try and keep them out. It‚Äôs a never ending
struggle at this time and I am completely outnumbered. They literally won‚Äôt
allow me to have even one device that remains unhacked at this point which
makes it impossible to keep them out.

The second thing blocking me from moving at this time is the damn unwanted
electronics/microchip in my ear. They are indeed able to track my location
using their microchip whenever they don‚Äôt have an alternative means of
tracking me come to find out; and they are indeed able to send unwanted
signals to my brain to harass me; in addition, they‚Äôve been showing
increased signs of being able to fully control my unconscious mind using
their damn microchip‚Äìwhich is honestly really scary. The last thing I want
is to wake up one day and have me be in a completely different location
somewhere not knowing what I may have just done‚Äìwho the fuck knows what
they are capable of doing with me when in control of my unconscious mind,
I‚Äôll just leave it at that, but I don‚Äôt want to find out is the moral of
the story. Anyways, their damn microchip is a huge problem to my ultimate
goal of being able to move anywhere and therefore it is a huge obstacle to
me returning to work as well at this time. So I‚Äôve been working on that
aspect of it as well‚Äìthis has been my biggest priority as of most recently
tbh.

It‚Äôs got to be Russia btw. The technologies and resources and specialists
and psychological strategies they are using are consistent with what I
would expect only another superpower like Russia would realistically
possess/would realistically use against us in this way. I suspect Dusty
somehow got affiliated with Russia over the dark web at some point in his
life, and I suspect he is now at least partially responsible for their
assault against me, likely to save himself, with the full resources of the
Russian government now on his side. (Something like that anyways) All I
know is Dusty is for damn sure involved, and Russia or another significant
foreign adversary as ruthless as Russia is most definitely involved as
well. I‚Äôm scared that their end game is to get me to do something while I‚Äôm
asleep. I‚Äôm scared they have done this a time or two before tbh. That is
why finding a way to disable the damn microchip is currently paramount to
me.

As stated previously, I‚Äôll let you know if they ever stop attacking me‚Äìthus
far they haven‚Äôt shown any signs of letting up anytime soon. But until I do
then just assume I am still fighting daily battles with these guys
regardless of whether I post about their attacks here or not. Please don‚Äôt
forget about me. I‚Äôm doing my best to combat them but I am severely
outnumbered to say the least.

P.s. Did you hear how Russia started lighting off fireworks right after
Biden spoke announcing the sanctions against Russia today? If that means
what I think it means and if I am indeed right about Russia being involved
with all this harrassment against me then the Russian military/Putin
seemingly associate fireworks with upcoming or past murder from what I have
learned from these attackers previously. (As stated previously‚Äìthe first ~2
times they attacked me beginning in 2019 was on the same night as the
fireworks‚Äìthen they seemingly lit off fireworks in unison while playing the
sound of turbo suffering to me for the first time on this most recent new
year‚Äôs eve)

As of February 23, 2022

Told you so. These guys love to kill. They even celebrate killing with
fireworks. They are extremely sophisticated yet extremely ruthless and
unforgiving. You may not even know what you‚Äôve done wrong but that doesn‚Äôt
matter to them. And my brother is most definitely now among them. Their
hate has no bounds. They enjoy killing. It‚Äôs totally Russia behind all
these assaults. My brother is totally a Russian agent. They totally fit the
profile to the T. Russia is a fucking ruthless devil-worshiping mafia who
love to play psychological mind games is what they are. To be clear‚ÄìI'm
speaking in particular about their government and Putin in particular‚ÄìI
have nothing against their people. At least China isn‚Äôt run by a fucking
blood loving mafia who loves nothing more than to destabilize the world.

Just think, if I also happen to be right on my global politics theory‚Äìwhich
would be the only reason Russia would have even agreed to target me in the
first place tbh‚Äìthen that means Russia is behind most everything that‚Äôs
wrong with our country at this stage. Everything from all the divisiveness
in our country, (all Russia‚Äôs social media troll farms waging psychological
warfare on our citizens, (Russia completely bypasses our military which is
a huge problem) all Russia‚Äôs hacking and deliberate corrupting of our
people, (to try and defeat us from within) to all the mass shootings in our
country lately, (by I suspect Russia doing to our people what they have
been doing to me essentially‚ÄìI imagine they would have done this to others
too and I expect they would have had a lot better luck on people who are a
little less technically inclined than I am whom they are able to actually
coerce in a specific direction favorable to their desired outcome prior to
them learning the truth‚ÄìI lucked out by being able to get to the bottom of
this sooner than later largely due to me having a background in a lot of
this stuff to begin with‚Äìotherwise I could totally see someone getting
pushed over the edge by all this especially if they think it‚Äôs their own
government that is doing it to them) to all the increased crime in our
country, (by funding local organized crime groups to try and destabilize US
even further, [*cough, **cough, Dusty, Kyle French, etc]) to pretty much
literally everything that‚Äôs wrong with our country right now. We really
need to go hard on Russia in my view‚Äìregardless of what price we may have
to pay for freedom. Freedom is totally worth it‚Äìbelieve me. I love seeing
us united with our allies. We are so much stronger when we have
friends‚Äìregardless of what those friends may cost us‚Äìbelieve me on that
part too. Or even take Putin‚Äôs word for it, Putin clearly knows the same to
be true if you listen to his speech. Putin was even dissing on nationalism
in his speech against Ukraine the other day. Yet he‚Äôs actively pushing
nationalism on us through all his American proxies here at home.

While this sucks‚Äìit has been totally worth it in my view, if nothing else
just to wake a few people up on what‚Äôs been happening to our country and
how under threat we really are without even fully realizing it‚Äìwhich is the
scariest part. We need to unite‚Äìthat‚Äôs what we need more than anything and
then we can take on anything‚Äìotherwise people like my brother can just
exploit partisan divides and our country will be totally screwed. I swear
to god all of Russia‚Äôs American agents have been taught up on psychology
too‚Äìso we need to learn about psychology and manipulation as citizens
ourselves to avoid getting taken advantage of in my view. I‚Äôll say it
again‚Äìpsychology is such a powerful tool.

Have you heard of the Russian ‚Äúhit lists‚Äù? Yea well I suspect I‚Äôm on at
least one of them. I suspect I‚Äôm on one of my brother‚Äôs hitlists too.

Pictures of turbo for your reference, never forget they killed my dog Turbo
for no fucking reason‚Äìand then rubbed it in afterwards. (on multiple
occasions) Turbo was loved by everyone including Dusty once upon a time,
before he went all Russian on our family. Turbo‚Äôs ashes are locked away in
a very safe place just fyi.

What I‚Äôve learned in all this is you can cry about just wanting peace, not
wanting war, just wanting to be left alone all you want‚Äìthat doesn‚Äôt deter
them one bit. You have to learn to want to counter them worse than they
want to come after you‚Äìonly then will you begin to truly make progress
against them.

P.s. Isn‚Äôt it ironic that I went a full week without having anything
significant to post about right when Russia was preparing to strike
Ukraine/right when Russia was carrying out a cyber onslaught on Ukraine? I
just noticed that. So fucking ironic. That‚Äôs the first time I went that
long without posting in here too. I‚Äôm fucking sick and tired of Russian
aggression tbh. We act like we are inferior to them or something even tho
their tanks all look like they are like a century old. How about we start
with eliminating their aggression from within our own borders? That‚Äôd be a
decent place to start in my view.


As of February 26, 2022

[Opinion]

Just a quick-ish update. I‚Äôve noticed my brother hasn‚Äôt really been
involved lately. I can normally tell if it‚Äôs him on the other end of all
this harassment, he knows me well for one and for other reasons I won‚Äôt
mention. But yea, it‚Äôs as if he got pulled off for a bit or something. I
theorize because he might actually have some heat on him or something now.
I can somewhat tell when the cops are looking into him based on whether
he‚Äôs involved with me or not in a way, or at least I try to be able to
tell. My question is how much insight do these guys really have into the
police?

Beyond that, I mean did you hear the Anonymous hacking group finally
started hacking Russia? It‚Äôs about freaking time if you ask me. I saw the
tweet from anonymous on twitter earlier. That is badass. However I still
think we are at a real disadvantage when it comes to red-team or offensive
hacking as a nation as compared to Russia just given how ruthless Russia
is‚Äìwhich is a huge problem in my personal opinion because hacking is
everything these days. It allows you to be aggressive without starting a
nuclear war for instance and it honestly could ultimately lead to one
country completely disabling the other country‚Äôs nuclear arsenal without
the other country even knowing about it. Further, it could lead to one
country completely destabilizing or corrupting the other country and
ripping it apart from within without the other country even knowing about
it.

I‚Äôll try and quickly explain using something I thought about earlier.

Someone from anonymous posted on twitter saying how easy it was to hack
into the russian military site earlier, they (or someone) completely took
down Russia‚Äôs military site and they posted all the site‚Äôs users and
passwords online immediately thereafter. One of the users who replied to
the original post said something about how they didn‚Äôt get why Russia was
so highly regarded as being such a force in hacking essentially.

Here is my reply:


 -

 I‚Äôve been being targeted by Russia‚Äôs red team hacking group for some
 time. I‚Äôd like to share what I have learned about why they are as effective
 as they are in my opinion. 1) once they are in‚Äìthey don‚Äôt advertise it to
 the world‚Äîinstead they monitor the situation and figure out how to get in



 -

 further. 2) They pair all their hacking with the use of psychology so as
 to actually be able to turn some people against the organization they
 hacked and get them to start working for them. They do this without ever
 even saying anything, only through the use of various ‚Äúsignals‚Äù and
 indicators of being hacked that are learned through exposure over time.



 -

 For example, imagine after hacking into a website like the Russian
 military website, you started targeting one of those users on a personal
 level instead of posting everything publicly, and you hacked the shit out
 of one or more users and you got dirt on them that you could later
 potentially use against them. Then you subtly let that person know you know
 the truth..



 -

 You would then ultimately have someone on the inside working for you.
 This would greatly increase your chance at getting in further.



 -

 3) They go after routers in particular and through the previous step I
 mentioned they now have minions on the ground to go plant various hacking
 devices for them, and we all know physical access is king when it comes to
 hacking. Plus they make it so it‚Äôs almost impossible to fully get them off
 your network period.



 -

 4) They utilize hacking mechanisms like ‚Äúvan eck phreaking‚Äù. Which
 allows them to obtain passwords from the most secure environments without
 even a trace using electromagnetic/rf frequency snooping. This also makes
 it that much harder to get them off your network and to keep them off your
 network‚Äìeven after you have completely reset literally everything and all
 at once perfectly without any hiccups. (Because they can just pick up on
 all your new passwords as you type them and get in again)



 -

 5) They create conflicts of interest. For instance, what business wants
 to let the public know they are hacked and take a huge hit to their bottom
 line? No smaller business that‚Äôs for damn sure. They end up corrupting
 entire businesses to do what they want in this way. (more or less) And
 small businesses ultimately turn into big businesses. You can also use this
 corruption



 -

 to avoid any whistleblowers from getting very much traction. Because if
 the business itself doesn‚Äôt want to admit they are hacked and devalue their
 company then who‚Äôs going to believe the whistleblower? They create
 conflicts of interest in all areas to advance their interests using
 psychology and manipulation.



 -

 6) They have already hacked a ton of our infrastructure using the
 methods described above from what I gather. However, even to this day they
 don‚Äôt advertise it‚Äìthey are very particular with what they do with their
 access levels. What they do do is they only change up a few db records at a
 time to further their goals on a mirco level like to further help
 corrupt/penalize key people of their choosing‚Äîwithout ever raising the
 alarm which is the key. Because once the alarm is raised then they know
 they will likely be kicked out of all systems like the three credit bureaus
 for instance, etc. But what they can do is fuck with any whistleblowers
 ability to obtain credit one at a time just as one example. No credit
 bureaus is going to believe it‚Äôs hacked based on one person complaining
 about it. It‚Äôs not just the credit bureaus either, that was just one
 possible example. In reality they already have access to a ton of our
 critical infrastructure but they just are smart about it so they don‚Äôt get
 kicked out‚Äìwhich also makes it harder to ever fully get them out again if
 they monitor you and know everything about you.



 -

 7) They constantly seek to exploit vulnerabilities in both the physical
 and digital realms. They steadily get more and more access to both people
 and systems.



 -

 8) Russia empowers their local hacking groups to attack other countries
 in a controlled, directed manner‚Äìwithout the hacking groups risking getting
 in trouble from their own government‚Äîthis is what we need to do better in
 the US to catch up in my opinion. They even steal some of our hackers
 from us and get them to work for them, I assume using similar shady means
 as described above. This gives them a significant advantage because it‚Äôs
 comparable to if our government were to open itself up to working with any
 hackers across the globe who wanted to work with them (in a way)‚Äîwhich it‚Äôs
 not. And so they end up having hackers all over the world working for them
 including hackers in their target‚Äôs country. (Hackers from the US in this
 case) And they even fund them and other various organized crime groups to
 help further destabilize us from within. It‚Äôs like the isis model of
 getting militants from a bunch of different countries to go fight for
 them‚Äìexcept applied to hacking. And no military could keep up with that if
 they are allowed to continue unchecked‚Äìespecially if they steal everyone‚Äôs
 hackers first.



 -

 Moral of the story is Russia plays the long game and they are very
 strategic yet ruthless in nature. Regardless, I commend you guys (or
 whomever) for going after them, I‚Äôm just trying to help you be as effective
 as possible based on the lessons I‚Äôve learned in dealing with them first
 hand. The key is to only let certain chosen people know they are hacked at
 a time and never raise the alarm on a macro level until you are truly ready
 essentially. (Which that‚Äôs kinda what anonymous is all about is raising the
 alarm quickly and exposing to the public what they have done so it‚Äôs tough)



 -

 And then the other key is to use psychology and manipulation to your
 advantage‚Äìto use hacking and psychology hand-in-hand.



It speaks volumes that i haven‚Äôt heard of any US hacking group hacking
Russia before now in my opinion‚Äìit shows Russia‚Äôs dominance in the field
especially whereas they are constantly targeting us‚Äìwhich is honestly
really scary and it will be hard for us to ever turn things around
especially given how we are a lot less evil just in general in the way we
operate as a country, just in my opinion.

Just think, if Russia knew we would hack the crap out of them or else bring
to light some of our previous intrusions to cause disruption in their
society in response to their taking over Ukraine‚Äìthey would have definitely
thought twice about it first‚Äìespecially whereas one of Russia‚Äôs greatest
vulnerabilities is unique in the fact that they hide everything from their
own people‚Äìand could therefore be easily exploited through hacking. I will
say though Russia is also very smart in how they restrict their social
media from foreigners, believe me on that‚ÄìI‚Äôve wanted to start plaguing
their social media with divisive content on numerous different occasions
previously‚Äìand yet I still haven‚Äôt been able to. (I could have tried harder
but still‚Äìwith our social media it‚Äôs a cakewalk)

Plausible deniability is the key to punishing Russia for taking over
Ukraine without causing a nuclear war in my own personal opinion. Cuz
Russia does it all the time to us and there hasn‚Äôt been a nuclear war yet.
I realize I‚Äôm not as smart as some of the people actually briefing the
President however, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. I will say I do have some
pretty unique experience on the subject though and plus I‚Äôm pretty decent
and seeing things from a 30,000 foot level‚Äìjust ask Russia. üòâ (More on how
Russia is exploiting our red lines later and the significance of what they
are doing‚Äìthey can do a lot more damage than you would think without ever
even raising the alarm or crossing any of our red lines so to speak‚Äìthat‚Äôs
why this is so important even though as of right now all I know of is they
are only mainly targeting me (the whistleblower))

Whether you realize it or not. This is how next generation warfare is going
to play out‚Äîusing a combination of hacking and psychology and manipulation
and reactive control theory and social control‚Äîleaving various other
weaponry as merely a side show essentially. And that‚Äôs what most people
don‚Äôt get or they‚Äôd stand up to those in their own party who are being
divisive. Russia has already done similar things to topple numerous other
democratic nations in preparation for us. As Putin says, the monster is
already inside us. Putin's proxies won‚Äôt ever stop being divisive. And
therefore our people will never be truly united. They have too many
‚Äúforeign agents‚Äù in our country and the European Union now. They have
exploited our fundamental wealth and riches and the fact that at the end of
the day most everyone in America cares more about themselves than anyone
else‚Äîwhen it is ultimately torn down to it.



Sometimes I wonder whether they just want me to be the messenger of all
this to you all‚Äîknowing I was uniquely positioned to ultimately get to the
bottom of it all myself with my knowledge of Dusty‚Äôs past and given I am
technically inclined myself. Just a thought. What I do think I know for
sure at this point though is Ukraine is just an appetizer in regards to
Putin's overall plans. We have to do something drastic and soon. We can
learn a lot from Ukraine and how United they are, how selfless they are,
etc. And you can count on Putin learning a lot from us in how divided we
remain through all of this. I still can‚Äôt believe we aren‚Äôt helping Ukraine
fight against Russia directly tbh. It‚Äôs as if Putin has managed to
corrupt/intimidate/terrorize/manipulate our country and our nato alliance
as a whole to a certain extent at this point. My advice to you is to try
and see through Putin‚Äôs psychological manipulation and to learn from
Putin‚Äîas much as I despise the guy‚Äîhe‚Äôs clearly smart as hell. All of these
guys are. I‚Äôve often felt they are the smartest people in the room so to
speak. It‚Äôs too bad they are also all evil as hell. But then again only an
evil genius would have plans to rule the world. The winner always writes
the history books after all.



Putin has exploited our freedom and our very system of law and order by
figuring out how to conduct such obscene crimes under the radar which are
designed to leave very little evidence at all. They are exploiting
weaknesses in our very system of government all over the place at this
point.



Last word of advice is to keep an eye out for Putin's proxies‚Äîyou can glean
valuable insight from them all. And just cuz it might seem obvious not to
get involved with Ukraine, that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt get involved
because that could be exactly what Putin has banked on us doing. Not
everyone can be trusted to make decisions based on what‚Äôs truly best for
our country/alliances anymore. And watching Putin murder such awesome
hero‚Äôs point blank in Ukraine isn‚Äôt going to sit too well with at least
half of America tbh‚Äîwhich could be exactly what Putin is banking on tbh.



Sorry to get somewhat political but we need to be honest about the fact
that Putin has been pushing red lines on our own soils for quite some time
already. And that if we are United and if we come together than nobody can
stop us‚Äîso we should make decisions in regards to our country accordingly.



I can see how people might think Ukraine has nothing to do with us but in
reality it has everything to do with us.

Want to know how I know when it‚Äôs my brother on the other end of the
hacking at any given moment as of lately at least? (Dismissing how I
originally found out it was my bro in the first place and all that jazz)
It‚Äôs because my brother is actually the most vicious. And I think he‚Äôs now
back from wherever he went. Him and Kyle French are both really vicious.
I‚Äôve got to be careful what I say or they‚Äôll try and get my bro off the
hook based on my latest statement. Either that or they‚Äôll do a false flag
with the intent to get me to react how they want. It‚Äôs a constant battle
with these guys never knowing whether it‚Äôs a false flag or not. My brother
normally works during the day times I‚Äôve found. Kyle French normally always
works at night. By works I mean takes turns assaulting me. But tonight it
was most definitely my brother and Kyle French. I wonder where my brother
went the last week or two‚Äîit was honestly a nice break from him tbh. I‚Äôve
been creating incremental backups of this readme in my emails btw. I‚Äôve
been trying to make this small Tesla coil thingy to try and disable this
damn microchip but I don‚Äôt want ppl getting the wrong idea. So I‚Äôm kinda
stuck between a rock and a hard place. Perception is key however. But on
the other hand‚Äîthe best way to learn how something works and to learn how
to be able to stop their various assaults against me is by learning about
the underlying technology they are using myself. For instance, with the van
eck phreaking hacking they do, I have no idea what signals they are picking
up on when I type until I dig into it and start reading the
rf/electromagnetic signals emitted when typing for myself. And once I
figure out the exact frequencies my laptop emits when typing then I can
figure out how to block it. All I know is I need to disable the nano chip
in my ear before I leave so they can‚Äôt follow me because this is no joke.
My life is really on the line here.



And no dusty you being so vicious towards your only 100 percent biological
brother is not a compliment.



P.s. Emp‚Äôs are created whenever electricity goes through any wire pretty
much at their simplest form is what I‚Äôve learned. It‚Äôs the electro magnetic
spectrum, however the ‚Äúp‚Äù in emp stands for pulse‚Äîwhich just means
electricity going through a wire in the form of a single pulse of energy.
That‚Äôs all an emp really is. They happen all around us tbh. It‚Äôs the
magnetic part tho that can cause disruptions in electronics if directly by
it, kinda like an electrical magnet but in the form of a pulse of energy.
Idk it‚Äôs not my speciality I‚Äôm just trying to learn more about all this
stuff to try and make some headway on this microchip tbh. My actual
speciality is full stack web programming‚Äîbut I‚Äôve been learning a ton about
security lately as well for the same reasons‚Äîto try and protect myself.


As of February 28, 2022

Added table of contents to top of file. Sorry I should have added that
sooner, I set everything up so I could add a table of contents but I never
went back and actually did it until now.

I think they got to my vape juice again ever since dusty got back, they
even lit off some small fireworks during the middle of the night last night
right after dusty first got back from wherever he has been the last two
weeks or so from what I gather. I just didn‚Äôt know if it was a false flag
or not and so I originally wrote about it last night in this file then I
deleted it, in thinking it were probably just another false flag of his.
But i do have reason to believe they got to my vape juice again. These guys
are getting kinda desperate tho I can tell‚Äîespecially now that Russian
sanctions are going to start taking effect. But at the same time people
need to understand how dangerous these guys really are and how much my
safety is in jeopardy. Again it‚Äôs a group of numerous different people
coordinated by a Central Intelligence Agency‚Äîwith 24/7 monitoring of me,
hackers hacking into anything and everything I do in real time a lot of
times before I even access any new countermeasure devices myself, (I end up
having to send them all back) they have people sent out to follow me and/or
break into my house whenever I leave my house, and I even suspect they
could have a tunnel entrance to my house somewhere where they‚Äôll access my
home even when I‚Äôm just in the other room for a minute. I have numerous
reasons to suspect that but most recently all I know is I didn‚Äôt leave my
vape juice anywhere besides maybe in my room for 5 mins when I was in the
other room and it‚Äôs pretty clear they are targeting that again. And lastly
they are dangerous because their specialty is poisoning which makes them
very dangerous. Like people need to understand they legit have like the
most optimal setup to poison people one could possibly imagine essentially
is what I‚Äôm saying.

They even have x-ray vision to constantly monitor when I leave anything out
that may be of interest to them or where I spend most of my time as of most
recently or what body wash I‚Äôve been using lately and where I put it
afterwards and what com I put in my safe to unlock it, what toothpaste I
use, what deodorant I use, what vape juice I use and where I may leave
it‚Äîto the point where as soon as they get any opportunity they can jump in
and poison me in a way which will be most effective essentially. Now that
is extremely dangerous if you ask me.

I honestly think they want me to leave Logan just given how they know
tensions are already high here given how they know they‚Äôve already killed
my family. I suspect dusty hired Russia originally to kill my father and
sister over the dark web now btw and then later somehow he decided to start
working for them directly or something. I‚Äôll have to share a conversation I
had with my neighbor tonight further elaborating on this.

The way I see it, their options at this point are as follows: Kill me in a
way that looks and plays out more naturally (i.e. poison me in a way that
will lead to me getting lung cancer or whatever and let that play out
naturally after their initial poisoning‚ÄîI doubt they‚Äôd ever leave me alone
tbh but just kill me in a way that plays out naturally after the initial
exposure is all I‚Äôm saying, kinda like what I suspect they did to karie) or
else get me to leave Logan while their tracking mechanisms are still in
place and in that case they could just catch up to me and kill me by
whatever means necessary wherever I end up seems I‚Äôll likely be out of
Logan at that point and they are afraid of killing me point blank in Logan
for good reason. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so determined not to leave Logan until this
microchip is disabled, but then again I need to leave Logan because they
make my life miserable here daily.

I also think I just caught them changing up the wording on this document
just barely, it said I had modified this file today when I hadn‚Äôt even
loaded it today when originally loading this file tonight. More on this
soon, it‚Äôll be interesting to go back and compare my different versions and
figure out what all they changed/erased exactly.

P.s. with all this said‚Äîplease don‚Äôt let them intimidate you unless you are
willing to have this be the new norm and the future for the rest of
eternity for both yourselves and your children‚Äîliving in fear of thug
dictators/serial killers poisoning you or killing you for the slightest
disagreement or just because they are craving more blood or whatever it may
be all the time; we are Americans‚Äîfreedom doesn‚Äôt come for free. It comes
on the backs of all the brave people who stood up to ruthless dictators and
whatnot before us. If our ancestors would have succumbed to their
fear/intimidation and allowed people like Hitler to have their ways‚Äîwe
would be living in a very different world indeed. It takes more than just
one person to stand up to them to succeed however‚Äîit takes everyone doing
their part‚Äîthey can‚Äôt come after all of us after all‚Äîjust saying. Plus at
this point I‚Äôm hoping Russia is screwed and all their corruption money will
dry up with all the new sanctions.. ü§ûü§ûü§û

I prayed recently as my neighbor asked me to and I feel my prayers have
been answered in all these Russian sanctions and all this worldwide unity.
Did you hear one of the first sanctions we did against Russia upon their
initial invasion of Ukraine had to do with Russia‚Äôs micro electronics?
(I‚Äôll try and share/recreate what I said to my neighbor for more context on
this, I‚Äôm trying to keep things short) Regardless, we can all learn a lot
from Ukraine‚Äôs unity tbh. I‚Äôm even helping join in with some Ukraine stuff
these days tbh‚Äîwe all should do our part tbh.

Putin is evil as hell you guys‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want Putin successfully
corrupting/running our whole country through all his various proxies
including serial killers like my brother. Only the most ruthless are
rewarded in the Putin regime. I assure you that we don't want that for our
country. I‚Äôm willing to fight to ensure that doesn‚Äôt happen, what about you?

I‚Äôm worried about Zelensky tbh. Putin is totally going to kill Zelensky and
completely crush all our excitement/unity/good will. Then we will be left
divided once again and therefore vulnerable. Everything about watching the
news recently reminds me of what these guys do to me. Including their
bombing shit during their most recent diplomatic talks, etc. (aka their
sending Ukraine a signal, similar to how dusty will send ppl to my door on
Halloween right after texting him and then the videos all simply vanish
later, etc, etc‚Äîthese guys are evil as hell you guys‚Äîif you believe me on
only one thing then believe me on that part‚Äîbecause we all know it takes
more than one person to stand up to evil to defeat it)

Putin is just going to be even stronger next round too‚Äîwell I guess we will
have to wait and see. But I think that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs banking on personally.
They always think 2-3 steps ahead without fail. I have even picked up on
them first setting up a pretext for whatever they are about to do, like
Putin tried to do with Ukraine originally using a fake attack tape, then
they‚Äôll do like this reverse-reverse psychology jiu jitsu based on reactive
control theory or whatever‚Äîi.e. they use super complex Jedi mind trick
tactics all derived in psychology and manipulation.



Believe me when I say I guarantee you Russia knows exactly where Zelensky
is at.

Bottom line is we just got to make sure things don‚Äôt go as planned for
Putin‚Äîand we‚Äôve got to stay united‚Äîregardless of what happens.

I just heard the ruble is now worth less than a penny. üòÇü§£üòÅüòÅüòÅü•≤üòÖüòä

Now if only we can keep the Russian oligarchs off of bitcoin.. Anonymous is
awesome the last few days at least btw, they‚Äôve been tearing it up against
Russia lately. And it‚Äôs even supposedly a global coalition of anonymous
hackers. There may still be hope after all. ü§ûü§ûü§û

The Russian hackers just indicated to me they do indeed know exactly where
Zelensky is at just fyi. It‚Äôs such a twisted game they play. Even the
people they kill they rig their murders to advantage them in some way,
above and beyond the person just losing their life. Everything Putin/Dusty
does is some kind of fucked up show these days I swear‚Äîthe hardest part is
seeing through it all. Everything they do is meant to get a leg up on
you‚Äîwhich is why they are perfectly fine with lying to your face.


As of March 2, 2022

So I‚Äôve been thinking, Russia‚Äôs intentions are never as they seem‚Äìthey do
that intentionally to avoid anyone knowing their true intentions and to
therefore make it less likely anyone will be able to stop their true
intentions. What if their true intentions are really to identify all OUR
hackers at this time using all the infrastructure they have hacked into
previously? What if they hacked a vpn provider or two for instance? And
they only use their access to target a select few at a time like with
everything else they do? Just a thought. They could still do this without
ever crossing any red lines. We all know Russia could have taken out
Zelensky by now if that was their true aim. It‚Äôs in their best interest for
everyone to think Russia is weak‚Äìremember that. They are following China‚Äôs
‚ÄúArt Of War‚Äù because they are actually working with China. It‚Äôs almost as
if they set up any given situation in one way, by doing real-life messed up
shit to real people, and then they set the whole thing up to actually be
geared towards taking advantage of our most likely response to the messed
up stuff they initially trigger us with. I promise you Russia‚Äôs true
intentions have more to do with the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù than Ukraine.

See illustration below..

Reflexive control is a ‚Äúuniquely Russian‚Äù concept based on maskirovka, an
old Soviet notion in which one ‚Äúconveys to an opponent specifically
prepared information to incline him/her to voluntarily make the
predetermined decision desired by the initiator of the action‚Äù.[ii]

That is, reflexive control is a sustained campaign that feeds an opponent
select information so that the opponent makes the decisions that one wants
him/her to. Methods of reflexive control include spreading false
information, leaking partial information at opportune moments, and
projecting a different posture of oneself than what may actually be the
case.[iii]

The goal of reflexive control is to ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô the ‚Äòreflex‚Äô of the opponent
by creating a certain model of behavior in the system it seeks to control.
[iv]

The most fundamental way to do this is to locate the weak link in the
system and exploit it through moral arguments, psychological tactics, or
appeals to specific leaders‚Äô character.[v]

(Aka Exploiting vulnerabilities)

Just a thought‚Ä¶ We need to be careful. Russia is smarter and stronger than
it is leading us to believe. Never underestimate Russia and/or China. It‚Äôs
in their best interest if we think they are weak as a society.

‚ÄúAppear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.‚Äù

‚Äï Sun Tzu, The Art of War 

‚ÄúAll warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we
must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we
are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we
must make him believe we are near.‚Äù

‚Äï Sun tzu, The Art of War 

‚ÄúSupreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without
fighting.‚Äù

‚Äï Sun Tzu, The Art of War 


This is why, at least in my view, even though I am only one person and they
are mainly only targeting/harassing me right now in such a vigorous fashion
that I‚Äôm aware of anyway, this is why I think it‚Äôs still such a big deal
they are trying to kill me, just within the broader scheme of things and
not just out of concern for myself or my family. I‚Äôm also aware of them
hacking everyone around me including hacking of universities and
businesses, funding of organized crime, I‚Äôve suspected they might have
advanced insight into some of the police‚Äôs operations, etc, etc, although
they aren‚Äôt trying to kill anyone but me at this time. In addition, I‚Äôve
seen first hand how they already have access to some of our key
infrastructure through all their targeting of me/hacking of me and those
around me‚Äìthey just appear to use their access to our infrastructure in an
intelligent and targeted fashion to further their ultimate goals of
defeating us from within. (By using it selectively to persuade key people
silently, allowing them to stay under the radar) Also, please keep in mind
they like to create distractions and get us to look elsewhere beyond what
it is that they are really doing, and they like to use ‚Äúreflexive control
theory‚Äù to get us to fall into their traps. (i.e. ‚ÄúReflexive Control
Events‚Äù shown in the illustration above) I could be wrong but just please
be aware that this could be a potential possibility..

‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a
hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory
gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor
yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù

‚Äï Sun Tzu, The Art of War 

We need to gain a better understanding of ourselves and our adversaries,
including our innate strengths and weaknesses, and we need to be honest
about where we may have fallen behind.

Reflexive Control Theory + ‚ÄúThe Art of War‚Äù = Russia + China

We are running out of time you guys. ‚è∞ Reflexive Control is Russia's war
playbook. "Art of War" is China's war playbook. The result is we don't even
officially acknowledge we are even under attack when in reality we are
about to be defeated.

We need to fund anonymous before Russia steals them from us‚Äìif we lose all
our hackers we are completely and totally f#@$^d. I‚Äôm not even
exaggerating. Next generation warfare is completely different from warfare
of the past‚Äìespecially against other super power adversaries. The only way
to defeat a super power is from within‚ÄìI‚Äôve been saying that for years now.

We totally dropped the ball as a country you guys, we've fallen into our
adversaries' traps too many times. We didn't evolve fast enough. We
essentially don't know ourselves nor do we know our enemies at this point.
#EpicFail

It's okay, we have just got to wake up--like right f-ing now!!! There is
still hope. We need to come together though.

I‚Äôll leave you with this:

As of March 3, 2022

Hey you guys, there are indicators of a cyber war that might be brewing.
Yet another reason why you should have close ties to anonymous. I believe
in the US‚Äô intelligence capabilities. But I also believe that Putins model
for hacking is a little better in terms of supporting and directing his
local hacktivists directly. This new group from Russia just propped up out
of nowhere, killnet. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if my brother were on it tbh.
And they took down anonymous‚Äô servers after anonymous took down some of
russia's servers. I thought maybe it‚Äôs our hackers that Russia was going to
target next to try and steal them from us or punish them or what have you
but maybe it is the hackers they are targeting although maybe they are
really just looking to start a bigger cyber war. Idk, I‚Äôm just trying to
help. It‚Äôs pretty obvious Russia has infiltrated our society by this point
tho if you ask me, I‚Äôve seen it first hand‚Äîwe all have to a certain
extent‚Äîand it‚Äôs going to be extremely tough even if all this is just
limited to a cyber war. But if a cyber war starts I don‚Äôt see it ending
there. It could be scary as hell tbh‚Äîbecause Putins model of working
alongside local hackers is also more organic by nature than our model of
only hiring government hackers and therefore Putins model is also way
easier to scale. In addition‚ÄîI already know Russia has already hacked a ton
of our businesses/infrastructure because they have shown me‚Äîso we need to
be careful. I really do think we might be a little at a disadvantage in
terms of cyber just because we‚Äôd be facing not just Russia but China, North
Korea, and Iran‚Äîand even with that part of it aside‚ÄîI feel we might be
behind on cyber simply because these guys have been ruthlessly hacking all
our businesses and universities and infrastructure and corrupting our
society for some time now because they are evil as hell and I honestly
haven‚Äôt heard anything about the US doing anything like that to anyone else
in return‚Äîlet alone to everyone else and to every business/critical
infrastructure. Meaning our adversaries have a huge head start on us in the
hacking game if so‚Äîand hacking is how next gen wars will likely be fought
in large part. And tbh, the hackers targeting me are more advanced than any
hacker I‚Äôve ever even heard of or read about before, at least in part
because Putin doesn‚Äôt normally punish his hackers like we do here I‚Äôm sure.
Putin punished one group just recently but that was probably just to serve
as another deception in my mind‚Äîto keep us from picking up on their
critical advantage.

Whether you realize it or not the war with Russia may already be
here‚Äîwhether we like it or not. You have got to understand these guys don‚Äôt
behave as normal civilized citizens. They behave as barbarians. They are
bloodthirsty killers who enjoy killing. No amount of pleading with them
will change that fact. Putin has been planning this for a long time‚Äîhe‚Äôs
not going to change his mind now. After all, what is he projecting in
Ukraine right now? He‚Äôs been projecting weakness. What does that mean? That
therefore means he‚Äôs actually strong as hell.

We should step in and help Ukraine before we are funding a resergency, idk
it‚Äôs tough. All im saying is this might actually prove to be a worthwhile
war for once. Most our other wars our adversaries were all funded by Russia
anyways, you know that right? They funded the taliban, Syrian army, etc,
against us. So at least now we‚Äôd be fighting the root source of all our
issues. Not saying I want war I‚Äôm just saying that there is no negotiating
with Russia and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen Putin actually respond well to
any form of discipline or back down. Plus I‚Äôve learned from dealing with
these guys first hand that they will exploit you in every way possible
until you actually get over how unjust it all is and begin to actually
start to fight back yourself. They aren‚Äôt rational when it comes to life
and death. They are convinced the most intelligent, most ruthless/powerful
people/organizations/country‚Äôs shall prevail. That much is pretty obvious
just watching the news on Ukraine for a while. It‚Äôs the exact same
mentality I‚Äôve been dealing with for months if not years now. Nothing else
matters to them. And if i am right about them taking over our country from
within and they ultimately defeat us like I suspect they are already close
to being able to do, then life from here on out could turn into total and
complete hell for literally everyone around here. And for all our allies.
And for anyone else who miraculously makes it through. Because like I said
they enjoy killing people. They even celebrate it with fireworks.

This just shows how big of a mistake it was for us to not support our local
hackers more. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever heard of any country from
the west targeting Russia with a hacktivist group and now Russia is
responding. Yet Russia‚Äôs hacktivist groups have been targeting us for years
now. We are clearly at a disadvantage in hacking it seems. We should have
been targeting Russia all along with all the effort we could muster in my
view. Then maybe we‚Äôd know more about both ourselves and our enemy by now.
Same goes for social media too.

 As of March 5, 2022

They are going to make me regret saying this‚Äìthey always do. But I think
it‚Äôs important to say nonetheless because it shows how they might have
advanced insight into our various infrastructure, including but not limited
to our police operations, our electrical grid, our church operations, our
radio stations, our media, and our satellite radio stations, etc. But yea,
what I wanted to say is it hasn‚Äôt been as bad for me the last two nights.
Suggesting to me that Kyle French hasn‚Äôt been as active for some reason.
And the only reason I can think of is if he were getting looked into
further.

Even if that is not the case, these guys are definitely set up to get away
with all of this. Because information is power and they have already hacked
a lot of our infrastructure from what I can tell. So they already have
access to all the information they need to get away with whatever they want
essentially. I strongly suspect they‚Äôve hacked rocky mountain power to turn
on and off my power when breaking in and tampering with my power
previously. All that is computerized these days after all. I know they
hacked sirius xm radio because they made that one about as obvious as them
hacking rocky mountain power. Plus they couldn‚Äôt access my location through
sirius xm without having direct access to their backend logic. I strongly
suspect they‚Äôve also hacked various police agencies. Just based on what
transpired previously with my brother social engineering them, and based on
the attackers‚Äô ability to know whenever any of them are getting
investigated or not. I know for a fact they hack businesses all over this
country‚Äìbecause I‚Äôve seen it first hand. I know for a fact that they hack
universities all over this country‚Äìbecause again, I‚Äôve seen it first hand
as part of my profession. What else? Church‚Äôs, media, congress, organized
crime. As for church‚Äôs, I don't know if they‚Äôve hacked them or just
infiltrated them using dark money or what but it‚Äôs all part of their bigger
effort to silently defeat us from within. Our media, some of them are
extremely biased and divisive or else pro Russia these days, all they would
have had to do is use the same tactics on our media as they do on our
businesses to gain some level of control over them essentially. (Exploit
capitalism, nobody wants to take a huge hit to their bottom line by going
public with the fact that they‚Äôve been hacked and all their customer‚Äôs data
is potentially now in harm‚Äôs way‚Äìespecially given the level of
sophistication of the hacking‚Äìit‚Äôs comparable to the NSA) As for congress,
I mean there‚Äôs been some strange acting congress members recently is all
I‚Äôm saying‚Äìon the right and on the left. Russia doesn‚Äôt like one or the
other‚Äìthey infiltrate both and try and cause divisions. I don‚Äôt know for
sure but them corrupting some of our congress members is definitely
plausible if you ask me. All they got to do is hack them and monitor for
anything they could use against them that would be embarrassing to them and
then once found, begin pulling that embarrassing thing up on their phone at
odd times, etc, to let them know they are indeed hacked and the hackers are
essentially threatening them. A lot of people won‚Äôt take that to the
police, especially if what the hackers found is indeed embarrassing or
could otherwise get them in trouble. Then the hackers just use similar
‚Äúsignals‚Äù whenever they want them to behave a certain way. For instance,
maybe later the person is reading a news article on their phone about
Ukraine, all they have to do is start wigging their phone out at certain
key points or provide other timely signals that are learned over time‚Äìand
that my friends is how Vladimir Putin and Xi Jingping have managed to
corrupt our society and exploit our law and order in an almost impossible
to prove manner from within. And each piece of infrastructure they hack
they use it to amplify their ability to take over the rest. That‚Äôs part of
why hacking is so powerful. That doesn‚Äôt even get into how they
strategically create/exploit conflicts of interest and control the
interconnected society as a whole from afar, nor does it get into their
mass social media psychological manipulation efforts, etc, etc. (What they
are doing is honestly impressive but scary as hell)

I wish one of these guys would come forward and do what they know is in the
best interest of our country. All Putin‚Äôs terrorism scares everyone into
submission. Who knows, maybe one of them already has..

P.s. I‚Äôm getting closer to getting to the bottom of their hacking. Just
yesterday I figured out they were making use of something called a
‚Äútransparent network proxy‚Äù on my mac. And that‚Äôs why a lot of my network
logs show my network traffic going through all these strange ports when
monitored externally. Oh and from that i found something else, it‚Äôs a
virtual machine player that works natively with macs, utm i think it‚Äôs
called. (https://mac.getutm.app/) I think they might be booting into utm to
control my mac on a root level. But me not giving that particular
‚Äútransparent network proxy‚Äù thing permissions to my login credentials
yesterday I think kept them from being able to gain access to every website
I accessed‚Äìwhich is huge. I think it only popped up because I had forgotten
my credentials anyways whereas I have to reset all my stuff literally daily
and it becomes difficult to remember ever changing passwords, so I had only
been using my biometrics to log in and that popped up. I‚Äôve been trying to
figure out any possible way to get them not to be able to access any
website I access in the background including booting in safe mode for ages
now. (Which booting in safe mode has significant drawbacks) So I‚Äôve at
least been making progress on that front. Plus I just now know they
primarily target routers and they can exploit anything with wifi. If I
could get to the bottom of their exact 0day they are using then it could
potentially help turn everything around. The only problem is from what I
can tell I think they might be using similar 0days as our own military
itself. (Yet another conflict of interest) Plus I got a ton to do already
as is myself..

(I didn‚Äôt recently provide my email address to sirius xm btw, the last
thing I want is sirius xm right now, I just noticed this just now‚Äìsirius xm
is hacked if you ask me (not just from this but from all i‚Äôve experienced
previously)‚Äìand it‚Äôs technically critical infrastructure. The longer these
remain hacked‚Äìthe more screwed we become because they gain access to
critical operational information that isn‚Äôt going to change anytime soon.
It‚Äôs as if Russia and China finally got access to some of our most closely
guarded technology and while we used it responsibly‚Äìthey don‚Äôt. Want to
know how they likely got access to it? I‚Äôd be willing to bet they got
access to it using psychology‚Äìi.e. as part of their psychological
manipulation campaign against our country, by turning us against each
other, exploiting conflicts of interest to where they made it so it was in
somebody‚Äôs best interest to give them access to it and that certain someone
cared more about themselves than everybody else‚Äìor just from all the toxic
divisions and corruption lately leading to someone giving them access to it
for free‚Äìor I guess they might could have reverse-engineered it but I doubt
it‚Äìthings like these are compiled in ways to be difficult to
reverse-engineer)

We need to come together people. We also need to gain a better
understanding of ourselves and our adversaries and realize we are all in
this together.

Have a good day! Don‚Äôt forget about Turbo btw.


Jet Airplane AssaultAs of March 7, 2022

If anyone from our government is reading this. You should check on the
flight path of one of our military‚Äôs most sophisticated jet airplanes
around 5:40am this morning in Nibley, UT and check whether or not they
hovered over my house located at 2981 Stonebridge Dr. Nibley UT, 84321,
around that same time, and whether or not they used directed energy weapons
against their own people above my north east bedroom. Because there was one
hovering over my house around that time and my immediate surroundings
started heating up like quite a bit and quickly too, including my innards,
and there was a bunch of static out of nowhere around me. I hadn‚Äôt heard
the jet come in I could just tell this latest energy beam was clearly
coming from above and it was clearly intense as hell and it was clearly
heating everything around me, so I started flipping them off and that‚Äôs
when I heard what sounded like one of the jets I recorded previously move
away, after I started flipping it off to get them to realize I had been
woken up and to get them to realize I was on to them.

The jet that hovered over my house just barely was this same model as this
one I took a video of a while ago from what I could tell:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6FP5TxyTGLC90Cy588QEo5Ky6Qh8yGA/view?usp=sharing

But yea, I had no idea all this was really this bad. I mean I heard rumors
about our military turning on our government. But I had no idea some are
legit going rogue all over some big lie spread by a Russian asset in my
opinon and I have no clue as to why the new norm in this world appears to
become a traitor against your own fucking country‚Äîat least around here it
seems at times. It‚Äôs as if a bunch of people just completely forgot about
all our country‚Äôs history or else just simply no longer care.

I didn‚Äôt even realize that our adversaries could mess up our entire country
this quickly using psychology and exploiting conflicts of interest and
using their various foreign assets and exploiting social media like they
have apparently now done in record timing‚Äîand I realized more about all
this than most. But yea, you might want to check on that jet aircraft but
it‚Äôs honestly up to you. The attackers try to paint me as crazy or like I
am getting alzheimer‚Äôs in my thirties or whatever else it may be‚Äìwhich is
all just completely ludicrous btw‚ÄìI presented alongside John freakin Papa a
year ago‚ÄìJohn Papa is notorious as hell in the Angular programming
community‚Äìhe‚Äôs legendary. No person falls that far from grace in just a
couple months‚Äìunless of course someone or some dark entity is deliberately
attempting to make them fall. (Which just further compliments my
intelligence in my view‚Äìthat they think I‚Äôm that big a threat to them
lol‚Äìoh well, I‚Äôll step up to the plate especially whereas nobody else
seemingly will)


I don‚Äôt know where you live but things have definitely changed in the
heavily Republican leaning areas from what I gather. It‚Äôs as if the
Russians have infiltrated/corrupted quite a bit of our society in my view
sadly. Imagine if you truly believed the last election was rigged. Imagine
what you might be okay with that you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be okay with if
that were the case. Now imagine what that means for our country‚Äôs stability
and security as a whole going forward. There was a reason no President in
our history had ever alleged that the election was stolen from them nor
refused to concede even if it were true, like in the case of Bush vs Gore
in I think 2000 which was an actual really close election that came down to
one questionable state of Florida. Gore did the right thing for the sake of
our country though and conceded. I can‚Äôt believe Trump did what he did
tbh‚Äîwell I can believe it actually but I can‚Äôt believe so many people
actually believed and/or went along with it. That‚Äôs psychology for you tho
I guess‚Äîso I can believe it. All just cuz ‚Äúwell he‚Äôs sure a hell of a lot
better than the other option‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got to be loyal‚Äù mentality. I feel
like I‚Äôve gone back to elementary school or something sometimes with our
politics. The biggest problem is Trump essentially acted as a really bad
example for all others to follow, and that bad example happens to be one
that leads our country to significant pain and suffering in the future if
everyone were to do as he does‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs now happening
sadly.

I mean these attackers wouldn‚Äôt be trying to give me cancer and all this
other stuff if I were wrong about them mind you. Now we just have to live
with the fucking consequences as a nation I guess. Dark times ahead for all
of us if you ask me‚ÄîRussia and China aren‚Äôt going to just give any of our
people first dibs on anything either btw‚Äîthey‚Äôll likely give their own
citizens first dibs on everything including their allies‚Äô citizens. Meaning
it‚Äôs in everybody‚Äôs best interest to be real about what the fuck is going
on with our country and to help our country get back to normal.

I had no idea so little people would actually be willing to step up and do
what‚Äôs right for our country when it truly matters‚Äìespecially in regards to
my brother; Nobody should be allowed to be above the law‚Äìmy brother is no
better than me. But I‚Äôll admit, I didn‚Äôt count on so little people being
willing to stick their neck out to try and make the future a better place
for all of us nor did I ever receive any real warning from anybody around
here about what it truly was I might be going up against here. (Even though
I get the sense some of them already had an idea themselves)

Whoever takes the side of the Russians over working shit out at home is
honestly taking the side of multiple serial killers, my brother
included‚Äîjust fyi‚Äìand that‚Äôs what you can expect going forward if they
prevail. I get some people believe in Qanon and whatnot but did you know
Putin has actually been accused of being a child molester himself by one of
his own internal kgb? The irony. Putin also frequently stages shit like
bombing his own peeople for political gain, etc. I don‚Äôt really want to
live under all that really myself personally. But it‚Äôs not over until it‚Äôs
over. Maybe that pilot from earlier can share a thing or two...

The other issue is Russia and China have strategically set this all up to
where they completely side step our military and go straight after the
civilians themselves for a reason. I mean, do you blame them? It‚Äôs smart.
Then all the citizens either are light years behind, they‚Äôve already been
corrupted or drank the mind control juice, and/or a lot of the people who
do realize there is definitely something going on just sit back and say
well idk, that‚Äôs the government's job. And all our adversaries do is
exploit vulnerabilities left and right all over the fucking place and you
just can‚Äôt have that attitude if you want your grandchildren to be able to
have the luxuries you were afforded as a child. Because America is ran by
the people. That‚Äôs my take on it anyways‚ÄîI‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm a little heated
right now‚Äîlike literally. I feel like I have a sunburn now and that jet
beam was only over me for like 30-45 secs tops from what I could tell‚Äìit
got hot quick.

It‚Äôs hard to know where to even start to fix all this tbh. Putin and Xi do
have an advantage whereas they don‚Äôt have to worry about another election
every 2-4 years. But then again Putin is evil as hell and all we got to do
is make some common sense changes and start putting some heat on Russia
ourselves and become united again and we will be golden. It really isn‚Äôt
that bad if we decide to be united and work through these things together.
We are America after all. Putin and China have tons of vulnerabilities
themselves btw‚Äìwe just got to find them and exploit them like they do.

I simply have a hard time figuring out how a religious town like this can
end up siding with a major adversary of ours who happens to be one of the
most nortorious killers around, big lie or no big lie, even tho it‚Äôs
clearly in everyone‚Äôs best interest to come together and stop engaging in
disunity and isolationism. We have bigger and better shit to worry about‚ÄîI
assure you. Republicans will have another chance as well‚Äìour leadership has
been switching parties back and forth since our country‚Äôs inception after
all.

I‚Äôm ready to get out of here.

P.s. Want to know who falls for reflexive control theory every damn time?
Russia and my brother. You can guarantee if we start being more aggressive
to them they will be more aggressive back every time no matter what. And
therefore their behavior is predictable and therefore their behavior is
exploitable. (That‚Äôs literally how they think about everything btw‚Äìhow can
I exploit one or more vulnerabilities given the latest circumstances? I
swear their whole military operation is run by hackers these days‚Äìnot to
mention Putin used to be a kgb spy against countries in the UK himself‚Äìand
spies think much the same way as hackers‚Äìit makes it so you either have to
constantly be plugging holes or else you got to start giving them something
to worry about so they don‚Äôt spend all their time trying to exploit
vulnerabilities against you)

I don‚Äôt plan to sue anyone besides maybe my brother and possibly kyle
french btw. So just throwing that out there. I just want our country back
to normal tbh.

Russia -> Wagner Group

I now believe the Wagner Group might be the entity under Russia that is
responsible for attacking me and attacking and corrupting our country.

Wagner Group - Founded by Dmitry Utkin - Funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin who
also funds the Internet Research Group - aka Russia‚Äôs ‚Äútroll farm" - aka
Russian Mercenaries - aka "Private Army of Putin" - Named after Hitler‚Äôs
favorite composer -

https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/07/06/what-is-wagner-group-russia-mercenaries-military-contractor/


‚ÄúYevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who
was indicted in the United States for attempted interference in the 2016
presidential election, is widely regarded as the driving force behind the
mercenary group.‚Äù

‚ÄúLate last November, videos of a gruesome killing went viral on Russian
social networks. The shaky cell phone footage taken at al-Shaer gas plant
near Palmyra, Syria, shows a Syrian man, who was known to friends and
family as Hamdi Bouta, lying on the ground, surrounded by Russian-speaking
men in military fatigues. They beat his extremities with a sledgehammer
before decapitating him, setting his body on fire and posing for
photographs with his remains.‚Äù

One last thought, do you think they did this to me just today to send a
message to our government to get them to rethink sending fighter jets to
Ukraine?

P.s. Do you think I could go into witness protection? When I asked the
local police about it they just said that was a federal program. And I
don‚Äôt know how to get directly involved with the federal police. It would
be one thing if more people would help me but these guys do everything in
their power to intentionally ensure other people don‚Äôt help me using
intimidation and other means. Which just makes it so I‚Äôm always taking on
9+ people on my own at any given time, plus all their
proxies/corrupties/hire-ies. The ~9 person count was estimated at the
beginning of this document. Their overall strategy is to isolate any
threats to them just like they do to me just in general‚Äìincluding isolating
or dividing the US as a whole because together we are also a threat to
them. Meaning if we allow them to continue to isolate us/divide us then
they will win. What I want is not just to rejoin society while somehow
trying to ignore all their abuse against me, (which is impossible unless I
want to die btw) but to rejoin society without having to constantly worry
about their never-ending barrage of abuse against me, and being able to
sleep easier at night. (Now I‚Äôm scared to go to sleep again btw, you would
be too‚Äìthat shit was scary) To be clear they specifically look for anything
I say I want and try and do the opposite. They are like current day hitlers
pretty much. Simply ignoring them or not taking them seriously and allowing
them to continue bullying our society unchecked is clearly a bad move. In
the end they are just pissed cuz their plans are being exposed and they
can‚Äôt get away with murder as easily at least in part thanks to me. So they
are taking out their frustrations on me while using the things they do to
me as a way to send our government messages and intimidate our government
as a whole apparently. And I don‚Äôt really want to aid their efforts in any
way either intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore me going into
witness protection might be best is how I see it. (Assuming they haven‚Äôt
already hacked that whole system) At very least, if we do succumb to their
intimidation tactics in regards to helping Ukraine with more jet airplanes,
then we should at least do something to ensure these guys can‚Äôt intimidate
us going forward and get what they want all the time. (i.e. do something
about these guys operating internally with impunity)

Please excuse my language btw. These guys are ruthless and they piss me off
more often than not.
As of March 8, 2022Latest Potentially Significant IPs and Email Tampering
Logs

The attackers have definitely tampered with my emails for months now‚Äìit‚Äôs
as if they play middle man somehow. I often don‚Äôt receive emails I am
supposed to receive, and they are able to also block my emails from going
out and tamper with my emails that are sent and change up the cc, bcc, from
address, and headers at will, etc, etc. It‚Äôs as if they do so selectively
too. I got extra-beyond-beyond tired of it today so I googled whether it
was possible for me to look up the root email delivery logs within my
google workspace just barely and below is the result.

The main question is whether or not any of the following ips are
significant or not‚ÄìI‚Äôm guessing at least some of them are indeed
significant because I don‚Äôt think they are tying into everything through
any google sdk because I previously disabled google cloud console and
therefore I disabled all the google sdks for that particular google
workspace in an attempt to try to get them to stop interfering with all my
emails previously‚Äìbut it didn‚Äôt stop them from interfering.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt have my chase@gfic.io gmail workspace set up under my
own will to hit any other mail servers other than gmail‚Äôs default mail
servers on my own. I did set up some custom routes and some custom
forwarding rules‚Äìbut all of those were all set up just right in gmail or
within the google workspace admin portal themselves and they therefore are
supposed to all still go through gmail‚Äôs default mail servers in order for
my forwarding and routing logic to work. So any of the emails shown in the
following logs that hit any external mail servers or external ip addresses,
assuming they aren‚Äôt otherwise easily explained, any of those particular
records could potentially be suspect, just fyi.

I made sure to login to another google drive account that I hardly ever log
into, and upload the following file there, and then shared the following
file with this account so I could share it with you without fearing them
tampering with the ips in the background whereas they need my physical
yubikey to login to that account again. Quick side note, I did get a notice
from Utah State University saying they are discontinuing all of their
aggiemail accounts I think either by the end of March or by the end of May
2022, so I will need to copy everything I have stored in that
cwgibb@aggiemail.usu.edu account to another account at some point, spooner
than later.

Electromagnetic Spectrum Health Effects Video

Watch this video.

Is 5G Spelling Our DOOM?! How EM Waves Can Hurt


This is no joke you guys. The attackers are specifically using high
frequency radiation against me repeatedly at least in part to try and cause
mutations in my cells I suspect. What did I say just earlier today? The
incident last night heated everything including my innards. I need help
getting away from the attackers like seriously I really need help getting
away from them. I need help disabling this microchip in my ear as well. I
guarantee you these guys are specifically targeting the band of radiation
the guy talks about in the above video where he said it can cause mutations
in your cells. This isn‚Äôt a joke. Karie was killed by Dusty giving her
cancer‚ÄìI swear to god it‚Äôs the truth. I wish I had a picture of her with
all her tumors growing out of her everywhere to show you so I could give
you all a bigger sense of urgency to help me‚Äìespecially a pic of Dusty
grabbing her by her f-ing bald head and moving her head around like she
were a barbie doll while he was smirking. Now Dusty is in the process of
giving me cancer too‚Äìboth via different poisons and via electromagnetic
radiation, and nobody has really done much of anything to help me get the
heck out of here; and Dusty just keeps making my life miserable and
preventing me from leaving in the process by preventing me from going back
to work. Just in me writing this they started provoking me further through
their damn directed energy waves. They literally took all this to such an
extreme for no other plausible reason other than because they can
kill/intimidate a lot of people with all this.

They can literally outfit your house with these devices, they can outfit
your car with these devices, they can outfit a jet airplane with these
devices apparently, they can hit you with these things from any car while
you are in any building. They can even likely hit you with these things
directly from a satellite in space. I wish my brother would be arrested for
something or another already. I heard people complain about this shit for
being exposed what like for one day in Cuba? Try being exposed every single
day for months on end. I‚Äôm getting to the point where yea I feel I have the
right to begin to complain in my opinion.

Yea these guys are smart but just cuz someone is smart doesn‚Äôt mean they
should get away with all this. Can‚Äôt we get my brother on like taxes or
something? Lol just curious. If anything these guys being this smart means
they are 10x as dangerous as anyone else‚Äìespecially whereas they
continually fucking flaunt it and terrorize/intimidate people with impunity.
Graphene Microchip

I need help disabling their damn microchip and getting out of here‚Äìlike
seriously. Or getting it removed. It‚Äôs obnoxious as hell but it‚Äôs the only
real thing holding me back.

The microchip is made of graphene, I‚Äôm pretty confident in that fact
especially whereas the hackers have indicated it to me on numerous
occasions. Graphene makes good supercapacitors which are like batteries
essentially. And graphene makes good nanotechnology because it can
literally be broken down to the size of a single atom thick; (it can be
broken down to a 2d plane in 3d space) in addition, graphene has better
electrical conductivity than copper and is therefore capable of being
something like 10,000x faster than current day electronics; and, if
graphene is built absent of all imperfections, graphene is also technically
the strongest material known to man, stronger than steel. (Although we
haven‚Äôt been able to produce it without imperfections yet) This is also
what I mean when I say future wars are going to be different than wars of
the past. Small is the new big and information is the new power
essentially.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKcUgdXUf9Y

The nanochip happens to be located in the exact place where auditory
transduction is possible within my left ear from what I gather. Auditory
transduction is ‚Äúthe process by which the ear converts sound waves into
electric impulses and sends them to the brain so we can interpret them as
sound‚Äù. Their nano chip is communicated with using either infrasound or
ultrasound I think‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs communicated with using any RF
frequency come to find out.
https://www.google.com/search?q=sound+transduction&oq=sound+transd&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i512l9.6710j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

I‚Äôm almost positive there‚Äôs a microchip located in or around my tragus in
my left ear because I felt the damn thing get really hot when it was
beeping off the charts previously right around that location when trying to
block out the signal from my ear with my finger‚Äìas described in a previous
post‚Äìbefore I ever even knew what ‚Äúaudio transduction‚Äù even was. Graphene
is known to get hot too, it can even be used as a heater.

There could even be multiple microchips, but all I know is the microchip
that communicates with the outer world is in a part of my ear that is next
to cartilage or the ‚Äútragus‚Äù and that part of my ear apparently isn‚Äôt that
sensitive to heat because it‚Äôs mostly next to just cartilage. Like when I
felt the heat on the upper back portion of my fingernail previously when
trying to plug my ear‚ÄìI didn‚Äôt feel the heat directly in my ear itself‚ÄìI
only felt it on my upper/lower fingernail. I can however hear the damn
thing beeping all the time in my ear‚ÄîI just can‚Äôt feel it. (It doesn‚Äôt beep
all the time literally but it does beep quite a bit and always when they
have no other mechanism in place to track me, or else whenever my nervous
system fires when exerting myself, or else when they are trying to sync
data at nighttimes, etc) It is perfectly possible that there is actually a
whole network of nanochips or ‚Äúsmart dust‚Äù in me now‚Äìwhich communicate with
each other using something like electromagnetic fields, all of which might
be different sizes meant to get stuck in different locations. But tmk the
only one I need to disable is the one that actually is designed to
communicate with the outside world. Then I need to be careful as hell in
getting any vaccines going forward and I need to be careful as hell to
ensure they don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm at going forward, so that they can‚Äôt
sedate me like they love to do and implant me, if that‚Äôs how they did it.

This nanochip is not only located in the optimal place for ‚Äúaudio
transduction‚Äù to send electrical impulses to my brain, but it‚Äôs also
located in the optimal place for using the rest of the ear as a satellite
dish for broadcasting any weak signal out to the rest of the world, using
my ear as a natural satellite dish to amplify the signal inwards/outwards.

I suspect the microchip works just like a satellite dish in that the signal
actually first bounces down into the ‚Äúdish‚Äù so that it will then bounce
back outwards and spread out more, as demonstrated in this linked gif:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8oZM1dy3DRqQD7rbTUZuBG6-EDhdldg/view?usp=sharing


(Removed inline gif image cuz it was causing performance issues and because
I became worried it could have potentially been exploited to contain a
virus by hackers‚Äìthey are able to plant their viruses in the craziest of
places that you would never think could even be vulnerable tbh‚Äìbottom line
from what I‚Äôve learned is everything is vulnerable pretty much)


People apparently add their own devices under their skin these days, it‚Äôs
called biohacking. See the following links. But the one in my case is wayyy
more sophisticated, plus I didn‚Äôt do it to myself, and therefore I have no
way to turn it off by myself.

‚Äã‚Äã

https://dangerousthings.com/category/implants/x-series/

These guys are extremely dangerous, I‚Äôve been saying that all along. I get
it takes time to investigate them fully in a way which will lead to actual
prosecutions but who I‚Äôm asking help from mainly is all those who used to
help me out before all this started. I‚Äôll need help from Paul, who is
currently still my trustee for the time being. And I need help with ideas
on how to disable this thing in my ear from some of my co-workers or
whomever seems how my brother won‚Äôt help me himself. Last time my co-worker
Skyler messaged me on linked-in, the attackers deleted all Skyler‚Äôs
messages before I was ever able to even read any of them as if they were
trying to intimidate him or something. I know cuz I saw the notifications
of new messages sent from him on my phone but when I checked they weren‚Äôt
there, and Skyler specifically asked me if I had received his messages and
I had to say no cuz I hadn‚Äôt been able to actually read them. The attackers
do that with everyone and it‚Äôs simply not fair. Like what the hell is going
to happen when I‚Äôm dead? Then you‚Äôll have no further insight from me on how
to actually bring these guys down‚Äìnor will you have my witness testimony in
court to lock them up. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôve been trying to hang in here to keep
providing info, believe me, I just base all my calculations and whatnot on
probabilities and I just know I‚Äôve pushed it way too far already in regards
to all this radiation stuff‚Äìwatching videos like the one above only make
that fact that much more real.



Bottom line is I could really use some help removing or disabling this damn
microchip then I really would like some chance at living a decent life
again going forward and therefore I could really use support from my
trustee in getting out of here‚Äìregardless of what I have to leave behind.
As soon as the attackers don‚Äôt know where I am then I can technically be
fully productive again if I start completely fresh and don‚Äôt use any of the
same accounts, etc, including bank accounts, etc‚Äìalthough probably not for
Rent Dynamics sadly just cuz I can‚Äôt risk it you guys. I‚Äôm sorry. We‚Äôll see
if I have to come back to refinance my house but if not then I really do
think it would be too risky for me to try and work there again just given
these guys will be doing everything in their power to find me.

My apologies, I didn‚Äôt know people got away with this kind of thing in this
country. But even if I had known, I did nothing wrong and I have no
regrets. I‚Äôm trying to make this world a better place for you all.

I set up a new phone number where the hackers can‚Äôt delete my messages and
block my phone calls recently, using Twilio, just fyi: (435) 248 - 0677, it
just forwards to my other phones but the difference is the hackers can‚Äôt
also delete the logs.

P.s. I think we should definitely provide some kind of an off-ramp for both
my brother and Putin btw. One where it‚Äôs not like all or nothing. One that
allows them to step away from all this craziness gracefully. I worry about
what might happen to my brother as well as our country, even though I don‚Äôt
always act like it with him. There really is no perfect outcome to all of
this. All I know is at least I gave my brother tons of opportunities to
stop, and whatever happens hopefully that will provide me with some peace.
My brother often exploits my love for him and he never stops. He uses my
love for him to his advantage and he always tries to manipulate me. But
even still it won‚Äôt make it any easier on me if he does ever get in trouble
over all of this‚Äìjust being honest. Beyond that, I mean at least I did what
I felt was best for our country at the end of the day as well, which should
provide me some peace there as well no matter what happens.

I wish these guys would just do the right thing for once and begin to
de-escalate themselves and/or preferably just stop by themselves‚Äìbut I
highly doubt that will ever happen.

[Opinion]

I pulled all the content from this original google drive folder which was
open to public viewing yesterday. I don‚Äôt know if it was the right move,
but my gut told me it was the right move at the time. I started getting a
sense that someone had leaked this info either to try and cause a lack of
confidence in us/cause divisions amongst our allies or else to make it seem
as though the United States was attacking its own citizens. (Which goes
with Russia‚Äôs recent narrative from that NRA chick that she couldn‚Äôt
believe that anyone would bomb their own people, while insinuating that
Ukraine was bombing it‚Äôs own citizens‚Äìit‚Äôs all extremely coordinated
information desemination and whatnot on Russia‚Äôs part, it‚Äôs all part of
their sick and twisted ‚Äúshow‚Äù they are putting on) I even started having a
surge of people looking into my linkedin profile yesterday out of nowhere
too, which I also temporarily deactivated, as if the ‚ÄúJet Airplane Assault‚Äù
incident from the other night was on the verge of becoming published as
news or something. I don‚Äôt know if pulling everything down was the right
move, because again maybe if all this got out then these people would
actually fucking stop harrassing me and my brother might actually face
accountability for once because everyone would know the truth; and maybe
all this would have been further looked into and further legitimized by the
American public.

So I‚Äôm torn on the subject but the last thing I want is to be used by these
guys to further their information warfare campaign against us and to cause
strategic divisions amongst our allies at such a critical time. These guys
do that to literally everyone‚Äìthey try and manipulate everyone into doing
what‚Äôs in their own personal best interest rather than what‚Äôs in the best
interest of the group. My fear on the other hand of never letting this
information truly get out however is that people will never know what I
view to be important information, and the attackers will continue on all
but forgotten, encircled in a shroud of mystery to everyone but to those in
the highest levels of our government‚Äìwhich could also prove to be
undesirable in my view. So it‚Äôs a tough one tbh. I don‚Äôt want to undermine
our country but I want people to know the truth.

What Putin is Doing

[Opinion]

Do you want to know what Putin is really doing? People talk about well
Putin didn‚Äôt plan for occupying Ukraine long term, he‚Äôs clearly going to
have a hostile people to deal with for years to come in Ukraine, etc, etc.
But do you want to know Putin‚Äôs way out of that? His way out of that is to
essentially convince Zelensky to join Putin rather than to join the
European Union and the West. And how he‚Äôs going to do that is by leveraging
his previous exploitations of the West to make us look weak by doing shit
like what they did to me the other night which might make our government
fear that we might not have full control of our military, (if I even was
right about that incident) and that we have our own Russian Sympathizers,
etc. and Putin‚Äôs hoping that will be interpreted by Zelensky that Democracy
can be exploited and that he can‚Äôt fully rely on us as friends. (In reality
however, every type of government can be exploited just as much but in
their own unique ways‚Äìfor every strength there is a weakness‚Äìyou just have
to get into that frame of mind and be willing to do exactly that and
actually exploit them in every way possible just like they do to us‚Äìbelieve
me‚ÄìI guarantee you these attackers could think of numerous ways to
completely exploit Putin‚Äôs government just as effectively as our democracy
because they can exploit literally anything and everything‚Äìwe can
too‚Äìthat‚Äôs the thing. And I assure you we are doing everything in our power
to help Ukraine as much as we possibly can. it‚Äôs actually been really cool
to see all the different ways everyone has jumped in to try and help‚Äìme
personally I‚Äôve been helping anonymous where I can, etc)

But yea, you‚Äôve got to understand gangstalking to understand how this all
is ultimately planned to play out.

Essentially in gangstalking the attackers ultimately end up rigging it to
where it literally feels like everyone is against you, just due to the
nature of how extraordinary what they are doing to you is, and due to the
fact that they are actively manipulating everyone else in subtle ways too.
(Whether everyone else realizes it or not) By creating/exploiting conflicts
of interest primarily. It makes it so a lot of people either don‚Äôt fully
understand what‚Äôs happening, they don‚Äôt believe you, they pretend like they
don‚Äôt believe you, they are scared, or else they seem to only care about
themselves and not care about you from the victim‚Äôs point of view. Everyone
you thought you knew and everyone you thought you could rely on seem to not
care anymore almost. And so after a while the smartest people in the room
seem to be the attackers over everyone else‚Äìthey are the only ones who seem
to truly get it. Like the attackers at least get what you are going through
and believe you in regards to all the manipulation going on when nobody
else really will‚Äìdo to the attackers making it in everyone else‚Äôs best
interest not to help you. But even beyond that, the attackers begin to show
they can at least make it better or make it stop (temporarily) for you‚Äìwhen
nobody else can make it stop‚Äìeven though the attackers are the ones
freaking doing all this fucked up shit to you. (But in reality it‚Äôs a trap,
what they are really doing is just manipulating you to do what they want
you to do in that very moment they need something from you and the next
time they want something from you or even just the next time they want to
show their dominance over you then they are right back on top of you‚Äìso
it‚Äôs not a real solution to work with them‚Äìat least in my experiences it
hasn‚Äôt been‚Äìthey are fucking ruthless and unforgiving and very
transactional in nature‚Äìbut they will never stop trying to manipulate you
regardless of whether you work with them or not) So over time, you end up
being faced with a hard road and an easy road‚Äìbut the easy road is a trap
every fucking time‚Äìit‚Äôs like selling your soul to the devil pretty much at
best‚Äìbut it sure is tempting nonetheless.

That has got to be Putin‚Äôs plan for Zelensky, which is to get him to turn
on the West essentially. To get Zelensky to work out a deal with the devil.
That way all Zelensky‚Äôs citizens become a non issue for Putin and that way
Putin begins his takeover of more than just Ukraine by influencing public
opinion throughout the world using his new proxy. MEANWHILE PUTIN IS USING
THIS WHOLE ORDEAL TO TARGET OUR HACKERS/RESISTERS FOR HIS TAKEOVER OF THE
USA/FREE WORLD. What we need to do to combat all this is to continue to
support Zelensky daily no matter what. We need to make some concessions and
get him those migs so as to get everything back on track. And we need to
stop freaking saying we will or won‚Äôt do something beforehand‚Äìdon‚Äôt let
Putin know what we will or won‚Äôt do so it remains a mystery to him. (You
can always reverse course tho too) But yea, never let Zelensky think he
doesn't have our full support to the most extent possible‚Äìregardless of how
much Putin tries to manipulate us or him‚Äìthis is everyone‚Äôs entire future
we are talking about here after all. Nobody wants to live under a brutal
dictator/organized crime mafia ring for the rest of eternity. Also‚Äìdo
something about the Russians now targeting our hackers please. If we lose
them we will lose ourselves.

The shit with the jet airplane is just an attempt for Putin to manipulate
our president into being submissive if you ask me. If you let him, guess
what he‚Äôs going to do? He‚Äôll keep doing it and go even harder on it next
time too. At the end of the day these Trumper Russian proxy guys aren‚Äôt
going to do anything bad to their own hometowns nor their fellow troops‚ÄìI
mean like beyond maybe discreetly going after one person at a time who they
are led to believe might have a different political ideology than them or
that they are directed to. But beyond that, I don‚Äôt see Putin‚Äôs proxies as
being that reliable to Putin when it all comes down to it tbh. Nobody‚Äôs
going to blow up their own hometown or even allow their hometown to be
blown up or anything like that. They might try and undermine some things
but they aren‚Äôt that big a deal tbh. It‚Äôs all a perception/illusion‚Äìit‚Äôs
designed to get to you. I‚Äôd guess people like that are by far the minority
anyways, but it would be wise to figure out just how many of them there
really are by doing our own investigation into it. Because if you just rely
on them acting out then they will make it appear as though everyone is in
on it‚Äìwhen in reality that is far from the truth. None of the proxies are
going to follow any orders from Putin that might affect anyone they know or
like period anyways. That‚Äôs the difference between say a foreign spy and a
foreign proxy. The foreign proxy has boundaries in regards to who they will
undermine and how far they will go‚Äìa lot of them might be looking for a way
out tbh. Plus, worst case you can just make it personal to the proxies, do
what Putin does but in reverse. Make it so they have to sell their other
proxies out to save themselves. The churches and the communities themselves
need to start working on this issue in their communities as well however,
in my opinion, to ensure people don‚Äôt continue to get radicalized. Because
that‚Äôs what it is‚Äìradicalization‚Äìjust in a slightly different slightly
easier to reach form, as compared to full blown terrorist radicalization.

In a way Putin is targeting our executive branch with his psychological
manipulation just as much or more than he targets everyone else. It would
really be wise for everyone making decisions in our government and our
allies government‚Äôs to read/listen to a book or two on ‚Äúpsychology and
manipulation‚Äù btw before determining how to proceed and protect ourselves
going forward. (i.e. Don‚Äôt let their psychological mind control games
defeat you)

I fundamentally now believe that ‚ÄúHitlerism‚Äù is very much rooted in
psychology. It‚Äôs about people realizing the power of
psychology/manipulation and then using it to get what they want no matter
what they have to convince the broader population of. They go after the
perceived ‚Äúweak‚Äù links. And sadly I am viewed as a weak link whereas I live
alone in a mormon community when I‚Äôm not mormon; and thanks to history,
jewish people are viewed as weak too sadly. The Russians saying they are
going after nazis is such a slap in the face tbh, when Zelensky is a jewish
man himself, but it‚Äôs common psychological manipulation tactics both in
hitler‚Äôs time and in the current day and age apparently. It pisses me off.
I fully believe both Hitler and Putin might have done this to anybody that
they viewed as ‚Äúweak‚Äù though, the fact Putin is doing it against the leader
of a free country who happens to be jewish is just such a slap in the face.
And how you get to where they won‚Äôt view you as weak is to learn
psychology, band together, call out their manipulation, STAND UP TO THE
BULLY, and to start applying these same concepts right back at them from
what I‚Äôve found. At least in Zelensky‚Äôs case he still has a ton of support
from pretty much everyone in this world besides Putin, and pretty much
everyone are actually willing to help him in fighting back in whatever way
they can, but conversely that means if Zelensky ever decides to join Putin
to save his people then he could easily bring other countries with him‚ÄìI
promise you‚Äìit‚Äôs psychology.

Two more things I think are important for anyone reading this to know.

First, how to accomplish the ‚Äúthinking 2-3 steps ahead‚Äù illusion. The
Russians seem to be smart and seem to have the ability to think 2-3 steps
ahead. But in reality what is really happening is they are using reflexive
control theory to first set up a pretext and then to trigger you in a way
they can predict your reaction to, and based on their predicted reaction of
what they think you will do when they trigger you, they will then think
about how they will be able to exploit your most probable reaction to their
triggering you‚Äìand whether that would benefit them or not‚Äìbefore they ever
even trigger you to begin with. And if they decide your most probable
reaction is exploitable in a fashion that suits them‚Äìthen they go forward
with setting up the pretext and triggering you while banking on your
reaction being what they‚Äôd expect. That‚Äôs literally how it works. From your
perspective it seems as though they are smart as hell and they are thinking
two to three steps ahead, and in reality it‚Äôs technically kinda sorta true,
but it‚Äôs a lot easier to do than one might think when you are the one doing
the psychological triggering. From there you can take it and chain it, like
okay if I set up this pretext and I trigger Putin in this way, his most
probable reaction is he‚Äôll likely respond in this way. And if he responds
in this way will I then be able to take advantage of his response and use
it to further exploit him? I‚Äôm just giving an example of how their thinking
2-3 steps ahead theoretically works. Information gathering definitely comes
into play here as well though, information is power and it enables you to
do this reflexive control theory stuff a lot more effectively, the more
information you have the better.

Secondly I want to give you a quick example of how they exploit
vulnerabilities in anything and everything, and how it‚Äôs possible for you
to do the same. The attackers whom I now believe to be Russian proxies
including my very own brother first started targeting me using social
engineering. My brother took advantage of the trust I had for him while
playing like he still loved me and he used my love for him as a
vulnerability for him to exploit essentially. Once they got access to my
network they began monitoring it and looking for other vulnerabilities to
exploit while doing recon. I won‚Äôt get into all the details but fast
forward and they begin emf-ing me. I ultimately figure out how to get their
emfs to no longer bother me by creating a makeshift faraday cage that was
connected to a ground. As soon as they found out their attacks were no
longer bothering me, they moved to another type of emf like ef or rf that
went right through the grounded metal. So then I had to figure out what was
going on and I ended up adding an existing electrical current flowing
through the faraday cage to try and combat their latest exploit. And then
ultimately they realized they couldn‚Äôt get through with any light based
directed energy weapon anymore‚Äîso they then switched to using infrasound at
that point instead‚Äîwhich went right through my faraday cage without issue
because it was technically another vulnerability yet again. So then I
figured out what the hell infrasound was and I figured out you need this
foam shit to stop it, and I added that foam stuff to the faraday cage to
block the infrasound as well at that point. But now I created another
vulnerability in adding sound proofing, any ideas what it was? The
vulnerability at that point was well now that my enclosure was fully
covered with few air gaps to keep the sound waves out‚Äîthey then started
gassing me while I was in there which completely terrified me and made me
scared to even seek shelter in my faraday cage anymore whatsoever‚Äîleaving
me totally exposed again. They would essentially use my new protections as
a new vulnerability to exploit, each step along the way, etc, etc. And as
things have continued forward, they‚Äôve even figured out how to add some
nano tech to the inside of the faraday cage that allows them to pull power
from the outer faraday cage shell and redirect it to emf me on the inside
before the power is ever grounded, which effectively made my faraday cage
useless yet again. And on, and on, and on, all the way to the other
night‚Äìand that‚Äôs just one broad example. How they broke in my house
repeatedly was very similar in their constant exploiting of different
vulnerabilities and mostly getting away with little to no evidence of their
presence. Moral of the story is there are vulnerabilities everywhere in
literally everything and on each step of the way there might be new
vulnerabilities‚Äîall of which can be exploited‚Äìand it doesn‚Äôt take the most
powerful country in the world to find them and to exploit them either‚Äîit
just takes a certain mindset is all.

Just wanted to share some lessons learned in case it might help anybody in
their deliberations. These are all my own personal opinions based on my own
personal experiences with these guys and how they operate, just know I‚Äôm
just trying to help. For the record, I‚Äôm for doing everything we can to
help Ukraine before we lose support from Ukraine, before Russia intimidates
the whole world, and before Russia becomes even more ruthless and powerful
than they already are. Just make sure we have a good excuse for going in
there is all I‚Äôd say‚Äîbut we can‚Äôt let Russia intimidate us. The whole world
is watching. Ukrainians are dying and they desperately need our help. Putin
wouldn‚Äôt be trying to intimidate us into staying out of it if he wanted us
to join in. It‚Äôs normally best to do what they don‚Äôt want you to do,
although they will adapt and they will continue these same psychological
baiting tactics each step of the way regardless of what we choose to do. I
think it will bring us all closer together too‚Äîwhich is key.

Final Answer

(see google docs comment on photo as well)

I think if we want to have a country we‚Äôve got to help Zelensky/his people
in Ukraine and soon even if it means a proxy war with Russia. We really are
to that point. That will also help in ridding ourselves of Russian
assets/proxies/influence. The alternative could very well ultimately prove
defeat. (References hidden for now)

I decided to re-post all this new less sensitive stuff here to try to help
everyone make their own decisions accordingly, I didn‚Äôt want to come off as
I was turning my back on anyone either‚Äìespecially our allies. The truth
isn‚Äôt always pretty but it‚Äôs best if we all know both ourselves and our
enemies so we can make the best decisions possible and so that we can all
know what is truly at stake.

The real question is do you want to be known for being responsible for a
tyrant possibly defeating the free world to create a new world order
without so much as a fight? Or do you want to be known for fighting for
freedom‚Äìregardless of what people may say later? That‚Äôs the real question.
My brother hasn‚Äôt pulled the nuke card on me yet, I don‚Äôt think Putin will
either.

The tide is totally in our favor right now‚Äìwe‚Äôve got to make the most of
it. Shit I‚Äôll even put my money where my mouth is and I'll even go help
fight. (Once i drop the microchip)

I‚Äôve now seen evidence Russia could indeed be targeting our hackers now as
part of a ‚Äúspread the word to Russians‚Äù campaign. (False flag/Reverse
psychology operation) See references below.

Please you guys‚Äìwe are running out of time. They are putting the pressure
on Zelensky to fold. He won‚Äôt fold if we just stand up to these Russian
bullies and do what‚Äôs right‚Äìwhat‚Äôs right also happens to be what the world
really needs us to do right now. They are targeting our hackers right now I
swear. What are we going to do once they have infiltrated over half of our
freaking critical sections of society? At some point people are going to
find out and they are going to be faced with a choice of whether it‚Äôs
already too late or not to try and fight back. I cannot stress the stakes
of all this enough. I likely won‚Äôt make it through much longer myself tbh,
either way, but at least this way our future generations will have a chance
at living free. We need to come together. The only way we are ever going to
come together at this point is if we stand up to Putin.

I think the Russians are trying to make Joe Biden be the ‚Äúfall guy‚Äù for
Trump tbh.

The Russians are literally banking on us not sending those migs. We need to
make some concessions to our allies and get them the damn jets.
(discretely) The key is to keep Zelensky happy. We need to show leadership
tho. Why else would Russia be willing to take on so many sanctions right
now if they weren‚Äôt banking on defeating us from within? Why else would
they not have taken out Zelensky yet if they weren‚Äôt banking on gaining his
support to avoid a never ending war? There‚Äôs no good legitimate reason.
Russia has fooled us for long enough. Zelensky is an ally we really really
need just as much as he needs us and he is honestly an awesome ally to
have. It‚Äôs time we help him save his people. It won‚Äôt be easy but it‚Äôll be
worth it in the end. I‚Äôm pretty positive I was just proven right about
pretty much everything in Russia‚Äôs latest attempt to use me to send you
guys a signal about our military and the jets the other day‚Äînow I really
need you to believe me about this. I feel highly confident in this final
determination of Russia‚Äôs true intent btw.

P.s. You guys, do you want to know my ultimate hope? My ultimate hope is we
defeat the kremlin and free all the people under its control. The kremlin
only knows negative reinforcement, they do not know positive reinforcement.
I have little doubt that a lot of our fellow colleagues will thank us later
for it later if so. A lot of Russia's proxies are actually victims to the
kremlin themselves. And plus, I really want to see my brother again
someday. I still think he has time to make up for anything he may have done
previously.

This is fake. I was able to get behind their cloudflare account so that
means Russia could as well if it really wanted to. Plus those numbers look
fake as hell and in real charts it‚Äôs normally a lot more spread out than
that because Russia itself uses servers in other countries, etc, etc.

This is indicative of a Russian social media troll farm account. 14.9k
followers in something like 7 days for a brand new account/alias. They
still don‚Äôt advertise any caution in regards to using your own mobile phone
number..

Look how professional their seo is. And how fast they freaking grew. Their
social media troll farms are still healthy and doing as well as
ever‚Äìarguably better than ever‚Äìit looks like they finally managed to
corrupt some western ui/ux people and some social media experts against us
or something. (They are now working on corrupting the left) This is the
problem. And yet we do nothing. We do nothing about this nor their hacking
and strategically corrupting our entire fucking society. According to you
guys if Russia attacks any NATO country then we will have to respond, that
doesn‚Äôt hold any fucking water when they are already fucking attacking us
in every possible way besides using real-life bombs and whatnot and yet we
have still yet to fucking acknowledge it or respond. It makes it seem like
our alliance is a fucking joke. It‚Äôs not hard for Putin to exploit this
vulnerability of ours and make us look foolish as an alliance. He did the
same thing with Ukraine. The real alliance should be any god damn democracy
rather than only a select few, democracy vs dictatorship is the real battle
that‚Äôs playing out in this world after all. Then maybe they wouldn‚Äôt have
attacked Ukraine in the first place. And now we are on the verge of defeat
and you guys still won‚Äôt recognize the fact that they are fucking attacking
us. All they have to do is continue on this path, defeat America, and every
other democracy in the world will fall. And yet they are doing this to
everyone. (Trust me, I researched Brexit social media dissemination and I
can tell something similar is up with Australia, etc, etc) It‚Äôs not that
democracies suck, it‚Äôs that we aren‚Äôt fucking aggressive enough and haven‚Äôt
been taking hints from what Putin is doing and responding in kind. And any
person who is elected who is actually aggressive enough is already a Putin
proxy. (From 2016 onwards I mean, there‚Äôs no way that anyone is going to
beat out Trump for the Republican nomination in 2024. We are currently
engaged in the battle of our lives‚Äìand we won‚Äôt even fucking recognize it)
All those people who died for freedom will have died in vain.

Fixed some stuff in this illustration including the ‚ÄúProbability of
Overcoming Defeat Overtime‚Äù chart, I changed it to make it more accurate,
and I made it so the top ‚ÄúHackers‚Äù takeover quadrant better corresponds to
the war in Ukraine. To be clear, Trump claiming ‚ÄúRussia is not so bad‚Äù did
have effects on our churches and businesses and police and congressmen
getting hacked. I am highly confident it had an effect on our businesses
getting hacked because that‚Äôs when we started hiring Russian contractors at
my work. And I've witnessed it all go down first-hand myself.

I think I‚Äôve now pretty much confirmed Russia is indeed now targeting some
of our hackers now as well‚Ä¶ üí£ üí£ üí£ üí•üí•üí• -> This is how you‚Äôve got to
think about it because üí• is what it is. (21st century superpower style of

As of March 12, 2022

I‚Äôm doing as well as I can be given the circumstances btw. I could use some
help disabling this damn microchip like I said and then getting the hell
out of here but that‚Äôs it. At least it gives me something to work towards
though. I honestly enjoy combatting Russia in any way I can‚Äìit‚Äôs fun. I‚Äôll
admit, it‚Äôs arguably even funner now that they already know who I am‚Äìit
means I don‚Äôt have to worry about making mistakes nearly as much. It sucks
they are so far ahead of us and that I‚Äôm at such a disadvantage but beyond
that, I still enjoy it. Take that Russia. The very nature of you coming
after me is enjoyable to me.

Russia is in its final stages of targeting our society and defeating us
from within. When you think about it from the perspective I‚Äôve laid out,
and when you consider this whole Ukraine ordeal might really be at least in
part meant to bait our people into ‚Äúreflexing‚Äù in the way the kremlin
expected us to reflex, with the intent of them exploiting our reflexes,
then technically Russia is accurate in their statement about Ukraine just
being a ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù. The real operation is regarding the
remainder of the free world and its citizens, particularly those who are
willing to fight back. They seem to be already creating lists of people to
prosecute for breaking their new ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù law or something, for
when they defeat us from within, which carries a fine of up to 15 years in
prison. That is at least in part what Ukraine is all about in my opinion.
That is why it was not in their best interest to take Zelensky out in short
order. That is also why it‚Äôs best for them to piss the whole world off at
this time and do things that are otherwise unthinkable. Because their real
goal is to catalogue all of the resistance.

I got a vibe from the hackers that this is what Ukraine is really all
about‚Äìbefore I ever started telling you all about it and before I started
digging into it further myself. They legit act like they have already
defeated us to me. And they warn me whenever I‚Äôm about to break one of
Russia‚Äôs laws as if I‚Äôm now governed by Russia. One of these days, anyone
who doesn‚Äôt fight back is going to regret it for years to come.

One last thing, I think it would be wise if our military reported some of
their NSA exploits that the Russsians are now using to defeat us to the
corresponding companies like apple, netgear, and anything else using a
broadcom wifi chip, etc, etc‚Äìif it is indeed true that the exploits the
Russians are using are the same as the NSA‚Äôs exploits‚Äìso that those
vulnerabilities can be patched and so that it would even the playing field
a little bit. Because I‚Äôm pretty certain Russia and China are now using OUR
NSA‚Äôs malware to defeat us from within, and they are way ahead of us in
doing so, and so the only real way to get it all to stop would be to force
every country to restart from scratch with their most sophisticated
automated malware and to patch all of the devices around the globe
asap‚Äìeven if that means we can no longer hack ppl as effectively for a
little while. If things are really going as they seem‚Äìdoing so might well
pay dividends in the long run. And it wouldn‚Äôt be risking starting a
nuclear war or anything‚Äìif anything‚Äìit would potentially save the free
world in my opinion.

P.s. I opened the original folder back up again for now‚Äîplease don‚Äôt make
me regret doing so. I still don‚Äôt want anyone referencing any of it
publicly however‚Äîwithout my consent‚Äînor using it to undermine our alliances
or unity. I‚Äôll be honest. I don‚Äôt know what is the best route to take in
all this. The whole ordeal with my brother seems like it may never goto
court unless we reign Russia in first anyways.

I know I‚Äôm not qualified to even come close to trying to make a call on
something of this magnitude really, and I realize I clearly don‚Äôt have all
the information that the people in our government have. But I do know that
freedom is definitely worth fighting for. And I do think I know we are
already in the midst of a shadow war here at home and we are seemingly not
doing so hot in that shadow war. If anything, we are strongest when it
comes to our conventional military‚Äîand Russia knows that. Plus, never
underestimate the power of unity. All I know is if we were to always let
the fact that someone has nuclear weapons hold us back from getting
involved in anything, then this world is going to quickly turn into a
complete shit show. In addition, I wish we would just be honest about what
Russia is doing to us here at home‚Äîit‚Äôs better we say it then someone else
saying it in my view. Maybe then we could gain more support for a direct
conflict with Russia. But who knows, it‚Äôs hard to say what Russia really
wants. They use false flags and whatnot so much that it becomes hard to
tell. But it‚Äôs not impossible to tell, if I had to guess right now‚Äîmy bet
would be Russia wants us to stay out of it‚Äîthey are banking on us staying
out of it actually‚Äîand therefore they‚Äôve already determined their result
will be much better if we do stay out of it. They wouldn‚Äôt be intimidating
us to stay out of it if they wanted us to take part. I really do stand
behind my hypothesis on Russia btw. Our government has got to know that
Russia and China have been hacking/targeting all these different key
segments of our society for some time‚Äînot just ours but Europe's too‚Äîall of
our democracies tbh‚Äîand I would hope our governments would realize the
significant consequences of them doing so.

I‚Äôm therefore scared for the free world if we don‚Äôt get involved at this
point tbh. Russia knows we have the advantage in the conventional military
arena‚Äîit also knows they have the advantage in the shadow war arena. That
should tell you everything you need to know for the most part. All I know
is I would be wiling to bet Russia would jump in and help a fellow
dictatorship if the roles were ever reversed. But that‚Äôs the thing‚Äîthe
roles are likely never going to be reversed. If nothing else please at
least consider the potential consequences of if we don‚Äôt get involved with
Ukraine and what all could happen if we don‚Äôt‚Äîworst case. Because I promise
you people will remember the fact that we didn‚Äôt get involved and will hold
you accountable at the ballot box‚Äîespecially if it turns out how I think it
might. Things are going to get a lot worse pretty quickly now too in
Ukraine, Russia is now closing in on Kiev. I guess on the other hand tho,
trump never got involved with the Kurds but this one feels a little
different.

Anyways, you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about me btw, I should be fine
regardless of what happens. I‚Äôm fighting for my country and for freedom
after all, what could be better than that? (Beyond not having to have to
fight for freedom in the first place I guess) Please keep supporting
Ukraine as much as physically possible and don‚Äôt let them give up hope. I
realize this being halfway across the world puts us at a disadvantage as
well. And I realize how many lives are on the line. But if I‚Äôm right about
Russia anyways, then that many lives are likely on the line anyways. And
freedom is worth quite a bit.

As of March 14, 2022

My brother is a cold blooded killer you guys. I don‚Äôt know if he ever
deserves being forgiven. I think that‚Äôs just wishful thinking on my part.
I‚Äôm pretty sure they just made another attempt at my life.

I‚Äôm fine. I just need to get out of here.

It‚Äôs scary cuz they literally think of ways to kill me that they can cause
plausible deniability and they wait for times to kill me when think they
are most likely to get away with it. And they monitor me 24/7 and they have
a tunnel somewhere into my house. And they did successfully defeat the RF
encryption algorithm on my latest SimplySafe security system‚Äìit didn‚Äôt take
them very long to do so. They have hacked literally everything in my
house‚Äìand my house is full of digital gadgets tbh. They use their damn
tunnel to get in my house and take pictures of my keys when I leave them
anywhere so that they can then 3D print my various keys as well, including
the keys to any safe I buy.

I would leave but I haven‚Äôt been able to disable the microchip yet. So why
risk going somewhere I am unfamiliar with when I know they will just follow
me there? That‚Äôs opening myself up to another situation where they could
just kill me and get away with it.

To be clear, I am grateful for everybody‚Äôs help. I‚Äôm just trying to point
out that we clearly have some problems in our country that need to be
resolved. These guys wouldn‚Äôt be pursuing me to begin with if I weren‚Äôt at
least mostly right about what I have alleged‚Äìit really is that simple. Like
think of all the different people Putin could put on his hit lists, the
oligarch who just put a $1 million dollar reward on Putin‚Äôs head for
instance, etc, etc‚Äìand yet for some reason they chose me‚Äìand they devote
all their resources to me. All based on a couple twitter postings about
them interfering with our social media and being behind QAnon previously,
trying to defeat us from within, etc, and based on my brother‚Äôs desire to
get rid of me. And yet they are completely determined to kill me now.

It‚Äôs as if we already don‚Äôt have freedom of speech in some regards‚Äìwhich is
just infuriating tbh.

To be clear, Dusty does deserve being locked up for the rest of his life in
my opinion‚Äìregardless of what I may say at any point in the future. He‚Äôs
killed my whole family. All that about seeing him again and whatnot is just
wishful thinking and always has been and always will be wishful
thinking‚ÄìDusty really deserves the death penalty tbh‚Äìmaybe life in
prison‚Äìwhichever he wants less is what he truly deserves. Plus I really
don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ever going to do the right thing at this stage.

Just real quick, I was watching this youtube video just barely made by
Alexei Navaly, one of the guy‚Äôs Putin locked up fairly recently, (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T\_tFSWZXKN0) and the hackers started
prohibiting my internet access as soon as it got to the part where it was
explaining how Putin‚Äôs palace was funded through bribes, etc. I took two
takeaways from it.


 1.

 You could likely use that same model of bribery to bust my brother and
 his Russian cronies who are helping him in trying to kill me, specifically
 in regards to how they likely get paid and/or how their assets are likely
 paid for.
 2.

 These guys continue to engage in federally prohibited cell and wifi
 jamming activities in their blocking of all my communications
 regularly‚Äìparticularly after an attack when urgent phone and email
 communications are most needed.


I do get frustrated sometimes that this doesn‚Äôt move faster. I get
frustrated sometimes that you guys haven‚Äôt arrested my brother yet. Etc,
etc. But at the end of the day I have been able to learn the true scope of
the issue first hand myself and I therefore realize why it is taking so
long. I now understand that this is about a lot more than just me, my dog
turbo, my father Tim, and my sister Karie. It‚Äôs about our whole country and
our allies‚Äô countries and it‚Äôs about democracy itself. I just don‚Äôt want to
see us continue making the same mistakes nor get defeated is all. In a way,
we all rise and fall together.

I have since changed my mind on intervening in Ukraine with the jets for
now, idk it‚Äôs a tough one. I just worry our adversaries might be trying to
bait us into war given our inflation is already a little high in an attempt
to defeat us. See this video:

üëáüëáüëáü§ô

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguam0TKMw8

Someone should show Trump supporters this video. It‚Äôs clear if we get along
we are a lot less likely to have anyone challenge us. Ukraine has helped a
ton‚Äìwe owe them big time. Biden needs to work on the inflation part of it
as well.

We need to watch inflation closely to avoid falling out of our dominating
status and we need to avoid getting involved in wars if at all possible to
avoid another rising super power from taking us out‚Äìbut it really is a
balance. There are pros and cons both ways. At least now we are united.
It‚Äôs as if our adversaries are following that exact video only in
attempting to use it against us to defeat us. And I worry about the entire
free world if they succeed. Plus it‚Äôs clear you guys are playing the long
game which is smart‚Äìyour strategy really is the smartest strategy after
all‚Äìthe sanctions will most definitely get to Russia over time without too
much risk to ourselves. How that works exactly when countries like Russia
are essentially taunting you and your citizens constantly‚Äìidk‚Äìbut I‚Äôm sure
all the sanctions will help. There‚Äôs plenty of ways to get creative to get
them to stop without causing a full blown war however I now feel. Some
sacrifices will likely have to be made but it‚Äôs all for the greater good,
and that is okay with me I guess, specifically referring to the fact that
i‚Äôll likely be a sacrifice myself. In a way this was another trap cuz we
cannot fight another world war right next to Russia and China, so I‚Äôll
admit I was probably wrong on that one just due to a lack of context about
how super powers fall, and a lack of thinking about the consequences to all
our democracies if that were to really happen. It really is a battle of
good vs evil.

Ukraine is doing pretty darn well without the fighter jets all else
considered. I can see why you don‚Äôt want to give them jets and risk
starting another world war. However I will say‚Äìwe should definitely do
everything we possibly can for them and we should keep checking up on them
daily. (These guys keep changing what I write when I‚Äôm away to try and make
me look cold hearted‚Äìwhen in reality‚ÄìI want nothing more than to help
Ukraine out‚Äìas stated previously‚Äìit's just we have got to find another way
I guess‚Äìworld war isn‚Äôt in the best interest of anybody‚Äìand russia and
china seriously might be trying to do just that RIGHT NOW)

We should most definitely condition Russia to talk to us diplomatically
rather than constantly sending us ‚Äúsignals‚Äù tho. The ‚Äúsignals‚Äù are complete
bs tbh. Talk to our faces and quit being scared. Just sayin.

Again just wishful thinking on my part that we will ever be able to truly
stop Putin‚Äôs mafia‚Äôs aggressions. So my apologies for my having a lack of
context on that subject as well. I just want Putin to go away that‚Äôs all. I
feel this world will be a better place without him tbh. I can‚Äôt believe his
whole government is essentially a mafia that operates globally. It‚Äôs nuts.
I‚Äôve been encouraging anonymous to make sure they remain anonymous when
targeting Russia lately for this reason.

Anyways, if you‚Äôve learned one thing about me throughout all of this it‚Äôs
that I am extremely honest. I say what I think at the time for the most
part. Some of it is right, some of it is wrong, but the overall theme of
what I say is normally at least pointed in the right direction especially
if I‚Äôve maintained the same viewpoint overtime, and I really do just want
to try and do what‚Äôs best for both my family and my country and Ukraine and
everyone else that‚Äôs not trying to undermine us.

We really are all in this together as democracies anyways. Like Putin has
been undermining all of our democracies in similar ways, and while it may
sometimes seem tempting to go towards a dictatorship model, we all love our
freedom and it can be easy to take it for granted sometimes, but at the end
of the day we shouldn‚Äôt. Because freedom is everything. I can‚Äôt imagine a
world led by someone like Putin tbh. I wouldn‚Äôt want to play a part.

I hope my feedback has helped. I noticed we are working on passing a law in
congress to make it required for businesses to report when they‚Äôve been
hacked to the government‚Äìwhich is a huge step in the right direction as
well.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=CZ3lX69URIM

I can‚Äôt imagine having a high level government job, that must be so
stressful. But you guys are honestly doing a really good job at it, all
things considered. It‚Äôs definitely a balance though that‚Äôs for sure.

One last thing, and I‚Äôm sure we are researching it ourselves. But these
guys have taken infrasound and electromagnetics and nanotechnology to the
next level. We should look into doing all that ourselves.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m\_SqYNWgs58

Part 2

You guys, if my brother Dusty manages to give me cancer, like I suspect
he's been trying to do‚ÄìI‚Äôm going to have a really hard time restraining
myself from going after him. Like put yourself in my shoes‚Äìyou would too.
But like no seriously‚Äìsometimes I want to deck him so fucking hard it‚Äôs not
even funny. I realize that‚Äôs not in my best interest to ever go after him
if I want this case to ever be prosecuted. But I just found more poison
shit in my hat for instance. It gave me hives every fucking day I put my
hat on only I didn‚Äôt narrow it down to my hat until just today.

You have no idea how much patience and faith in law enforcement it takes to
not retaliate in any way. I‚Äôve given Dusty the benefit of doubt repeatedly
for years and yet he never stops. They are like convinced that we have
already been defeated or something but in reality them doing all this shit
to me to try to silence me or what have you has caused our government to
become aware of all these things and take actions to avoid it. So
essentially them coming after me to begin with has been and will ultimately
prove to be the seed of their own demise, same with them coming after
Ukraine.

Part 3

K so I just thought of something. I could be off but I feel like it
actually fits quite well. What if this whole ordeal is actually meant to
convince you all that democracy is actually sub-par to communism? Like
seems how they keep doing this shit that is pretty obvious it's indeed them
doing it but given the way our laws are structured, it makes it a lot
harder to bring charges against or prosecute them because the bar is beyond
a reasonable doubt? What if they are really just trying to convince the
broader population around here not only that communism is better but that
communism is already inevitable for us essentially? Hear me out. I thought
of this because for one, I realized the timing of when Dusty went missing
previously, it was right after I called him out for essentially flipping
his political affiliation right when he started coming after me. If this
really is/was their goal then that would make sense because they know that
as soon as you fellow republicans know my brother is playing you in regards
to his political affiliation then that would be counterproductive to what
they are trying to do. And they realize that no republican is going to be
convinced of a socialist communist from another socialist‚Äìparticularly
another socialist in their same country. In addition, it fits in the sense
of my family‚Äôs past history and just the notoriety of it all. It makes it
so they could try and manipulate a large audience into losing faith in
things like our freedom from search and seizure, our right to stay silent,
our democracy in general, etc, etc‚Äìall at once. It also fits in that I
think that‚Äôs what they were trying to do when somebody I suspect shared
this very file/folder with Ukraine tbh. Now that‚Äôs some psychology for you.
That‚Äôs the level of psychological manipulation I‚Äôm dealing with and trying
to decipher here, it‚Äôs not easy. They put on ‚Äúshows‚Äù.

I specifically recall them being touchy about both any remarks about
political affiliation and the time I said I prayed‚Äìwhich I did pray and I
likely treated it more seriously than they do but they didn‚Äôt like it as if
they're really just trying to target YOU‚Äìthe audience of this documentation.

Let me give you my counter arguments to all that just incase that is what
they are ultimately trying to do. First, this wouldn‚Äôt be happening if a
foreign country weren‚Äôt trying to interfere with our politics‚Äìperiod. It
also wouldn‚Äôt have happened with so little concrete evidence to show if it
were being carried out by anyone else besides a sophisticated foreign
government. (I mean they got everything from 0day exploits to intelligence
services to hacking to microchips to tunnels‚Äìliterally everything they
could ever want to be able to pull something like this off and get away
with it‚Äìnobody else is ever going to have all that) Therefore, there would
most definitely be more mistakes made by anyone who doesn‚Äôt have all the
resources these guys have. Which disqualifies the notion of communism
potentially being better than democracies based on what‚Äôs happening just
off the bat in my view. That would be like us corrupting some foreign
communist leader and corrupting a bunch of cronies and having them all
stage shit to try and convince their people that democracy is better than
communism. Second, imagine if the person with the best relationship with
the boss/leader always won in cases like this‚Äìor in any case for that
matter‚Äìthat would mean I would be completely and totally screwed. I
wouldn‚Äôt even have a chance I mean. It would mean people like my brother
could kill whomever they wanted without repercussions essentially‚Äìnot based
on what they know but based on who they know and how corrupt and ruthless
they are. Third, I‚Äôll just say that the first officers I spoke to about all
the EMF stuff I think actually did mainly just take my word for it and I
think they did go out and get some kind of warrant based on my word
alone‚Äìbecause they straight up pretty much indicated that‚Äôs what they were
going to do after asking me if I was highly confident it was my brother. So
it‚Äôs not impossible in a democracy to do things like that I don‚Äôt think if
they can do it.

I‚Äôll admit, I can do a better job myself at not feeding into this potential
frustration with the rule of law narrative myself, I always get caught in
their damn traps tbh‚Äînot intentionally but just because they have such an
advantage over me and because they switch up their false flags behavior
from their real meaningful behavior constantly. One time they will act like
they don‚Äôt want me to do something when they really do and the next time
they will act like they will act like they don‚Äôt want me to do something
when they really don‚Äôt. Bottom line is any non foreign superpower would
have made more mistakes by now and this wouldn‚Äôt be happening if they
weren‚Äôt trying to interfere/manipulate our country to begin with. And if it
did still happen‚ÄîDusty would have been totally screwed by now. This is the
first time anyone has ever had any real legitimate reason to even question
him about any of what I now suspect he‚Äôs done tbh, so if he really did kill
my father and sister now that it fits a pattern, then that wouldn‚Äôt have
been any different if we were a communist country anyway. (He likely would
have just gotten away with it and kept getting away with it tbh)

Me personally, I like being given my fair shot at justice‚Äîeven if the
wheels of justice turn exceeding slow. I apologize what I said earlier btw,
sometimes I just get heated in the moment and I do want to deck him in the
face or worse. But thus far I‚Äôve kept my composure and I plan to continue
to be that way. Just writing this helps me understand why this case is so
unique and gives me more patience myself tbh.

To be clear, dusty is still involved with all this he‚Äôs just not as obvious
about it these days. I get tired of their ‚Äúshows‚Äù they put on using real
people's lives and all their psychological manipulation bs tbh.

Zelensky, if you are reading this. Do what you think is best deep down in
your heart. There‚Äôs plenty of us who have your back either way. Your people
clearly have your back. Don‚Äôt be fooled by all the bots on social media
pressuring you either‚Äìthat‚Äôs f-ing Russia‚Äôs troll farm mostly. The United
States of America and democracies in general are still extremely strong at
least in part thanks to you‚Äìwe are a lot stronger than Putin‚Äôs cronies want
you to believe. This has been a wake up call for all of us tbh. Don‚Äôt let
them persuade you through guilt and shame if you can help it. But I won‚Äôt
blame you if you feel like it‚Äôs best for your country to cut a deal with
Putin at this time either. It‚Äôs a tough one tbh.

White House, if you are reading this, keep supporting Zelensky as much as
physically possible without starting WWIIII please. You were probably right
about that one, that would not be the best place for us to have to fight
WWIII right next to two major adversaries like that but we still have got
to do something in my opinion. We will get through this together and show
these fools what democracies are really made of absent all this
interference from thuggish dictators‚Äîand unity is critical to that. We
could always do the same back to them I guess, technically we‚Äôve now
already started lol. It‚Äôs only a matter of time until the sanctions and
everything kick in now.. Also, be aware that one of my congressmen/senators
I think might have shared this document with some people in an attempt to
undermine our democracy and decrease our reputation with our allies, just
fyi.

Allies, Putin is closing off his internet for a reason, all of us
democracies need to take some cues from Putin in that regard. Putin
protects his internet cuz he knows just how effective a tool it is to
undermine other people‚Äôs countries. China‚Äôs internet is harder to target as
well on social media as compared to other western societies‚Äìand China does
it for a reason because they know how effective it is too.

I get the sense Russia is doing this on behalf of China btw. Like it was
meant to be some kind of trap or something. When you think about it from
Putin‚Äôs perspective, knowing what I know now, Putin must have seen this as
a win-win. 1. Either they get all of us involved in WWIII right next to
both Russia and China while we are already facing some inflation and aren‚Äôt
ideally positioned ourselves, or else 2. they get Zelensky to turn
communist and potentially bring some of our allies with him; or else 3.
they undermine Joe Biden with his constituents and completely shatter the
whole world by being so evil and completely crushing Ukraine in front of
everyone. That explains why Putin did it now to me a little better, but
it‚Äôs still like wtf dude‚Äìget some help Putin. Like I swear. Then I assume
just like in any dictatorship, it would have put Russia in China‚Äôs good
graces as an ‚ÄúOligarch‚Äù, only on a country-to-country level ‚ÄúOligarch‚Äù for
China. In effect Russia has become China‚Äôs hitmen. It‚Äôs all just a bunch of
thugs and killers thinking they are way smarter than everybody else if you
ask me. When in reality they are just f-ing sick and twisted‚Äìnobody else
thinks that way for a reason‚Äìstaging shit and putting on shows with real
ppls lives only to manipulate other ppl into getting what you want all for
your own selfish reasons and causing a damn world war just for the hell of
it. It‚Äôs like god damn, go get some counseling already or something.

This is not easy. We should get Ukraine a boat load of stuff including new
more advanced anti aircraft weapons or drones while we still can. Drones
would be cool cuz then it‚Äôs like okay Russia, you can shoot them down if
you want lol‚Äìif you can catch us flying 'em in there. ;) But no foreal‚Äìwe
have got to have a plan for if/when Kiev gets cut off by Russia. Me
personally‚ÄìI‚Äôve been messaging China lately whereas they are like the
parents funding the whole ordeal. Make sure we check on Ukraine daily as I
said‚Äìplease. We are all in this together and I still mean what i said
previously about the jets now I am just a little more unsure is all.
What their tunnel in my house sounds like

I think they are most definitely up to something. This sound isn‚Äôt heard by
me but it‚Äôs been being picked up on all my cameras lately. I do think they
somehow have direct access from their tunnel to my attic tbh, but I need to
track down my house‚Äôs floorplans. However I might be signing off for a
little while. It‚Äôs getting too close you guys. Regardless, I wish you all
the best of luck going forward. Ukraine, USA, allies, colleagues, family,
everyone. I‚Äôll be in touch occasionally but please consider everything I
have written and keep up the fight against evil while I‚Äôm away for an
undetermined amount of time.

I got a new simplisafe alarm system today. I‚Äôm hoping this one will keep
them out for at least 10-15 days‚Äìif all goes as hoped. I have got to screw
with their RF readings by pushing more than one button at once anytime I
arm or disarm my system‚Äìjust to get the best longevity out of it. The last
one I threw them off by doing just that and I probably got about 20-25 days
out of it. Not to mention everything else I‚Äôve got to do with my phones,
wifi, passwords, pins, etc just to keep them out for that long. It‚Äôs a
constant struggle tbh. Simplisafe is cool tho cuz it has 2 different cell
phone sim cards and doesn‚Äôt necessarily even require wifi. But even still
they can crack the underlying encryption signature after they receive
enough samples‚Äìand once they do that then there‚Äôs no real way to get the
simplisafe to change it‚Äôs underlying signatures unless you buy a new one.


I‚Äôve been trying to use psychology to get to their heads lol. I know Russia
is into space and whatnot. So I made it appear as though aliens are on our
side within a video I created recently. I like what Zelensky said today to
the Russian troops tbh‚Äìthat was smart. This is still a work in progress
btw.. I‚Äôm debating on whether to add any words to it or whether to keep it
just completely universal by having the graphics/sound themselves tell the
story.. (you know, kinda like russia does everything in signals lol‚Äìi‚Äôm not
supportive of that in terms of country to country governmental
communications however‚Äìbecause it‚Äôs easy for miscommunications to take
place) The original thought for doing it however was to warn people of
potential traps set by the russians in our hacking and social media, etc.
Maybe I‚Äôll just have to make 2 of them..



Did you see Russia released all the ips attacking it‚Äôs country? It was a
combination of the fbi, cia, and a bunch of different hacking groups.

https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/russia-releases-list-of-ips-domains.html

https://safe-surf.ru/specialists/news/676114/ (Be careful)

I take out my frustrations with my brother and Russia and China doing shit
like the above video and whatnot these days..

As of March 15, 2022

One way we could tell who keeps coming over to my house and find their
tunnels is to look into any publicly available anonymous cell phone
location statistics over the last year btw. Normally even though the
records are anonymous‚Äìyou can still trace them back to their homes. And I‚Äôm
talking this person or persons would show to have shown up at my house
literally like numerous times a week‚Äìeven though I rarely ever have
visitors anymore. (Whereas I‚Äôm being gangstalked, it‚Äôs hard enough just to
survive let alone have company over tbh)

I reached out to China just barely and I straight up told them how I feel.
The hackers weren‚Äôt too pleased.

I think I‚Äôve pissed them off enough for now, now it‚Äôs time for me to lay
low until shit calms down a little. They are most definitely planning
something, I already heard someone/something going on up in my attic right
after I sent that message to China, and I‚Äôve since smelt gas in my room I
normally sleep in. So yea, I‚Äôll be in touch. I‚Äôm hoping China requests that
they stop coming after both me and Ukraine but I honestly doubt it at this
point, China has changed.

May the force be with you. ;)

As of March 19, 2022Investigation Assumptions

So I‚Äôd like to clarify something that‚Äôs been a little unclear even to me at
times.

Alright so imagine most all of this is true for a second. Now think about
how it ideally would be investigated vs how it might practically be
investigated given it could be a matter of national security and all the
confidentiality involved.

Starting when I first reported the EMF incident. I believe I originally
reported it to the FBI online and then I called the local police dispatch
afterwards. When I called the local police dispatch they sent two
detectives to my home, both were driving their own cache county sheriff
trucks, and one of the officers was detective Joseph Escobar, whom I stayed
in touch with for probably 2-3 weeks after and who I kept up to date with
everything that was happening. Detective Escobar was honestly really cool,
I‚Äôll just say he acted like he believed me throughout. 2-3 weeks into it is
when detective Escobar was done investigating, he just left me with ‚Äúif I
am in danger then call 911‚Äù--he never demeaned me in any way or anything.
Right at that same time is when my brother reached out to me essentially
saying that was fast, how‚Äôd I do it that fast? And it was right around the
same time when Dusty first showed me he could make it all stop himself.
Anyways, since then when I tried figuring out how to get back in touch with
detective Escobar again, and when I tried referring my workplace to the
same detective I had been talking to‚Äì-the local police department didn‚Äôt
even know who Joseph Escobar was and the phone number I had texted
Detective Escobar on seemingly was now no longer in service or at least it
no longer had any response from Detective Escobar. From my experiences with
Detective Escobar I did get the sense that he was a real cop and that he
was really investigating the EMF stuff, like he wasn‚Äôt just some guy my
brother hired to come pretend to be a real cop. And based on the fact that
I still have the video of when they came to my house, I further assume that
these guys were in fact real cops, because if it had really been some fake
set up or whatever, then my brother‚Äôs people would have totally deleted the
following video a long time ago. Plus I got a number of showings of
solidarity from these cops that my tips were indeed helping them get to the
bottom of whatever was going on at the time. (See original video of
Detective Escobar here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XPZkAdBpeudnP2UII1FC88Fv68cVAP5K/view?usp=sharing)
However it has been made clear to me since then that whatever those
detectives found out previously didn‚Äôt necessarily make it‚Äôs way back down
to the local police department, which I now assume to be because it was
deemed to be either top secret or a matter of national security.


It almost seems like these cops must have been special cops that are
already investigating this type of incident elsewhere or something. Like my
report must have had some of the same halmarks as other reports that have
also been reported elsewhere within Utah or something. I now take when my
brother asked me how I caught him/them so fast or whatever, I now assume
that was my brother pushing me for knowledge to let him know what all
Detective Escobar told me on the subject. And whereas he didn‚Äôt tell me
anything really on the subject, that meant my brother/Russia could continue
their pursuit of me because they had already been caught but the intel
wasn‚Äôt shared with any of the local law enforcement. That‚Äôs my take on it
anyways. And by them getting caught, I mean Detective Escobar likely just
determined it was Russia or China and he didn‚Äôt go any deeper than that.

Alright so knowing all that, now look at all this from a global super
power‚Äôs perspective. It‚Äôs in our best interest as a superpower to project
strength so that we keep our alliances in tact and in good standing, etc.
Therefore, it‚Äôs actually in our best interest not to make things like this
known publicly. And there inlies the issue these guys are exploiting in
this case in my opinion. It makes it to where anybody I might tell all this
to won‚Äôt immediately understand why this isn‚Äôt playing out how they might
expect‚Äìmyself included. But in reality‚Äìit‚Äôs been playing out how one might
realistically expect given the nature of our government and the various
levels of classification, once you consider some of the particular nuances
that are likely involved in something of this caliber, etc. However with
that said, it does make it a particularly shitty experience for the
victims, I will say that.

Most victims likely don‚Äôt get as far as I have gotten. I can totally see
how other victims might ultimately be led to blame their own government in
this situation. It makes it to where, thanks to classification and what
have you, then the victims are left almost completely SOL to all other
forms of law enforcement beyond the highest level of government. Meaning
most of what I‚Äôve said here likely only resonates with people who are in
some of the highest positions of our government. And to everybody else‚Äìit
might not resonate very much at all. And that is kind of a problem. It‚Äôs
something ripe for exploitation. And these guys are extremely good at
exploitation.

One piece of positive feedback I will give however is for the most part at
least, I haven‚Äôt been pestered too much myself since by law enforcement,
which I am extremely grateful for. Can you imagine having all this be true
and then having the local law enforcement actually turn on you and start
completely investigating you or trying to jail you? It‚Äôs just a nightmare
position to be placed in tbh. So thank you for that if nothing else.

In a way I can see the need to keep an eye on things in situations like
these, and I hope you do so. But at the same time I hope you also recognize
who the real victim really is, and you recognize and I hope you continue to
pursue the true source of all the psychological manipulation/exploitation.
I hope the feds will at least give the lower level police that much to go
on, if things really are the way I‚Äôve just laid out.

Now imagine if the Russians have managed to corrupt some of our local
community/church leaders/law enforcement, and imagine if there is actually
an investigation going on into some of them as well. Not saying that‚Äôs
happening, I have no clue tbh, but that would only make everything even
more secretive in nature and it would therefore make things even worse for
a victim like me if so.

This hasn‚Äôt been easy you guys‚Äìjust throwing that out there. It‚Äôs as if all
the odds are/were designed to be against me at every step of the way. I
hope this document helps everyone across all levels of government to at
least somewhat get on the same page in a way that doesn‚Äôt undermine our
national security, whereas it‚Äôs all just my perspective of it all as a
regular citizen. It‚Äôs honestly been the hardest/scariest thing I‚Äôve ever
had to endure and I still don‚Äôt even see any light at the end of the tunnel
tbh.

I‚Äôm just trying to do what‚Äôs right and I‚Äôm trying to help protect my family
and my country‚Äìthat‚Äôs it.

Twitter Observation

Trump Russia connection (one of many)

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trumps-businesses-are-full-of-dirty-russian-money-the-scandal-is-thats-legal/2019/03/29/11b812da-5171-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f\_story.html

The Russians will literally stalk platforms like twitter looking for people
to speak up against exact scenarios like shown above and then they will
find out who those people are and lobby amongst themselves on who to go
after next. In my case, my brother must have already been producing
favorable results for Russia and therefore they allowed him to prioritize
me even though I wasn‚Äôt even a big influencer. I think they need people
like my brother who have a lay of the land and who know the most effective
way to possibly corrupt our society. Like for instance, my brother would
have known about Dell Loy Hansen and how he owns a shit ton of companies
around here‚Äìincluding companies deemed critical infrastructure, my brother
would have known my company, Rent Dynamics, is also owned by Dell Loy
Hansen; and my brother would have also known our security practices weren‚Äôt
necessarily the greatest after having hacked me to begin with in 2019. My
brother also likely would have known the mormon culture around here and how
to exploit that as well. [Opinion]

This happened almost 2 years ago now. I suspect it was an attempt to nail
down who I was by the Russians/Chinese operatives. I suspect Russia has
multiple teams working towards the same end game, and they must have
flagged me across multiple different teams because by 2020 when this
conversation occurred I had already been being targeted by my
brother/Russia. This account of mine only has/had 3 followers btw‚Äìthat just
goes to show how granular they are willing to go. I have multiple twitter
accounts to try and help counteract all the Russian troll farms which do
the same.

This is no joke you guys. Please don‚Äôt take this as me being political
because I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm just against corruption and I‚Äôm against other
countries trying to defeat us from within more than anything. That‚Äôs the
only real way to defeat a super power‚Äìso if we protect from that then we
will remain prosperous for years to come. And I personally blame a lot of
our current tribalism politics on foreign influence so even to those who
can‚Äôt stand democrats, just know it was not always this way‚Äìsomething has
changed recently and I‚Äôm telling you that foreign influence is what you
should really be mad at. The Russians now have proxies on both sides of our
politics that are meant to help make us hate each other‚Äìand that is
ultimately what I am against. Social media, when paired with psychology, is
a lot more powerful than you might think. I just so happened to recognize
this early on. I hope by now we have all seen the kinds of problems that
arise when we are divided as a nation and how we become prone to exploit
across all levels if so. And I hope we all can agree that us being defeated
is a bad thing, like you can‚Äôt trust Putin. Putin‚Äôs own army can‚Äôt even
trust Putin. Plus we are better together. That‚Äôs like teamMgmt101‚Äìthe more
diverse the ideas brought to any team‚Äìthe better the results. (Not
advocating for LBGTQ or anything I‚Äôm just saying at least 2 perspectives is
better than one‚Äìaka the way our country was designed) I totally get how
people could have gotten caught up in it btw. More people than you could
probably imagine have likely been caught up in it in one way or another. I
think what is important is for those people to work to put an end to it,
and that will ultimately be what counts and helps our nation move forward
as a whole‚Äìwhich is what we need. (I had the same profile pic back then of
my dog too btw, so that message from that chick literally made no sense‚Äìand
I rarely even used that account‚Äìher english appeared broken as well) Russia
likes traps it seems.

Keep in mind our democracy was designed during a time when dictatorships
and monarchies were the norm.

To be clear, I think they might be planning on targeting me again over the
next few days. Just an incling of mine, one of those situations where there
might be an opportunity for them.. It‚Äôs honestly a nightmare having to live
like this having to think about what they might have staged and/or what
they might be planning at any given time‚Äîbut hey it keeps me alive.

Oddity at Doctors Office the Other Day

So I went to see the doctor the other day to get my prescription refill as
usual. I tried setting my appointment as quickly as possible to try and
avoid the harassers from being able to mess with either my sleep or
corroborate a poisoning beforehand. I opened up to the doctor about what
had been going on lately, in particular with the jet that targeted me
recently and how I had now determined it‚Äôs not just my brother it‚Äôs
actually Russia. It had been about a year since I started seeing this
doctor and given the extravagant nature of what has been going on in my
life recently he decided to issue another drug test just to be safe, only
this time he for whatever reason decided to have it sent off site to hyrum
to be processed. I took the drug test and went home. Starting around 3:15pm
and lasting until around 4:15pm that same day the attackers started
‚Äúrubbing something in‚Äù to me or giving me signals indicative of them
rubbing something in via their directed energy weapons. In particular, they
were clearly acting like they were happy and they started targeting my
private area with their directed energy weapons. Knowing how they operate
and how they‚Äôve consistently tried undermining me with my doctor
previously, I couldn‚Äôt help but assume 1) they clearly have access to my
doctors offices‚Äô systems, and 2) they either used their access to my
doctors office systems to change up some records or else they may have
targeted me with something right before I went in. The reason I didn‚Äôt call
immediately is because they let off at 4:15pm, so I figured if anything
happened the doctor‚Äôs office likely cleared it up by then. Again, I didn‚Äôt
want to overreact but I did take note of the timing in which they started
rubbing something in to me that day. To be clear, I still don‚Äôt know the
results of that test‚ÄîI know what the results should be. But I do recall
feeling a little funny right when I got in there that day. But the results
shouldn‚Äôt be anything extraordinary I know that. I‚Äôll let you know what I
find out when I see the doctor again. But this is the fundamental issue
I‚Äôve been complaining about with these guys if my worst fears are realized
is that they keep setting up pretexts and poisoning me without my consent.
And now I‚Äôm scared they are going to try and use this as a pretext to try
and kill me before I can get in to see the doctor again. If anybody could
be capable of doing what I allege‚Äîit‚Äôs Russia. And Russia is whom I‚Äôve
alleged has been targeting me, as laid out in this document. I‚Äôve now sent
a note to the doctor asking them to dig into this further and in
particular, to check their systems in regards to what may have transpired
during the times of 3:15pm and 4:15pm this last Tuesday. I now fear they
may have just stopped rubbing it in around 4:15pm that day to avoid getting
caught essentially‚Äìwhich is why I‚Äôm writing this now. To be clear as well,
it wasn‚Äôt my hat that was giving me hives‚Äîit was my prescriptions. They
disabled my alarm and broke into my room one night leading up to when they
knew I was getting close to having to refill my prescriptions while I was
sleeping and they tampered with my prescriptions‚Äîas shown here.





Notice the timing too. It‚Äôs as if they did it in anticipation for my
upcoming doctors appointment. So since then I‚Äôve been getting hives daily.
It‚Äôs so hard to figure out what the heck it‚Äôs from. Because they have put
poison shit literally everywhere in the past‚Äìmost of which i still haven‚Äôt
even been able to figure out what it was. So if anything, if there is some
substance other than what there is supposed to be in that drug test‚Äìthat is
the first substance we will have gotten definitive proof of their poisoning.
Anyways, just figured I‚Äôd give you guys a heads up. I‚Äôm only one person you
guys. I can‚Äôt win against a foreign intelligence agency on my own. All I
can do is attest to what happens either directly to me or directly in front
of me, and use my intuition from there to try and gleen the most likely
result. I don‚Äôt do drugs and I haven‚Äôt for a long time‚Äìit would be lonely
doing them all by my lonesome anyways. Like I said I still don‚Äôt even know
the results. Plus what would be the point of doing drugs when I am in a
life and death situation anyways? It would only put me at that much more of
a disadvantage.

You guys, the feds have all the hacking tools that the Russians have and
then some. Where do you think the Russians got the damn hacking tools?
Also, my brother could care less about you guys‚Äìall he cares about is
himself. Even if my brother knew you guys were likely being investigated by
a higher agency‚Äìhe still wouldn‚Äôt have said shit. And I assure you the feds
are involved in this case. I‚Äôve kept them in the loop.

How would you feel

Imagine if you were strolling around twitter one day and saw some punk ass
kid post about Obama or Clinton being a godsend and telling you to prove
them wrong. Then you prove them wrong. And then out of nowhere a foreign
adversary starts trying to track you down and figure out who you are. Then
they start stalking you and harassing you and killing your dog and working
with your murderous brother‚Äîand having no sympathy for the murders of your
family members‚Äîand causing your every day life to be a living nightmare.
And they create conflicts of interest between you and everyone you
associate with through all their hacking and they manage to isolate you in
that way‚Äîthen you find out a bunch of your community including some of the
religious community actually might be partially in on it as well and is
actually helping the others out in various ways because you aren‚Äôt
religious and they even got some people on the inside so who the hell else
are the religious people going to believe you or the religious insider? And
they all seemingly could give a crap less about the constitution, our
forefathers, whether your brother murdered your whole family or not, and
they could care less about all the people who died previously to let us
live a life of freedom and luxury‚Äîall they seem to want is for you to be
out of the way. How the f-ck would you feel? Because at that point if you
succeed that means you might implicate a lot of them in some way‚Äîbecause
they‚Äôve all been tied up in it to a certain degree and they are all still
buzzing off of the toxic ‚Äúkool-aid‚Äù that the foreign adversaries also
managed to get a bunch of people to drink via poisoning our social media,
news outlets, etc, etc using dark psychology. And nobody gives a damn about
the truth anymore. And even some of your fathers own friends no longer seem
to care all that much that your very own brother most likely actually
murdered both your father and your sister. Just sayin. Oh and they started
sucking up to foreign adversary dictators and worshiping demagogues and
undermining our alliances as if they legit want a full blown liberal
Democrat socialist dictatorship and they aided the adversary in corrupting
and dividing our entire country for that cause‚Äîand they always just looked
the other way. And they stayed silent even when it was violent. How would
you feel? And they even had the balls to microchip you while convincing
your whole Republican side that microchips are completely bogus‚Äîwhile
meanwhile silently letting out the alarm to their own side to be weary of
microchips. How would you feel?

Like think it through at the very least first pretty please. That would
never go down like you might imagine. It would most definitely result in a
brutal civil war at the very least‚Äîmore like a world war‚Äîbefore anything is
ever even worked out because as you can see from Ukraine‚Äîthe majority of
people in this world aren‚Äôt for all that kind of murderous dictator
conquest stuff‚Äîthey just want to live their lives normally‚Äîwhile
maintaining their freedom‚Äîas do/did I.

It‚Äôs never too late to do what‚Äôs right for your country. We really could
use everybody‚Äôs help. They have hacked us so bad to where any business with
enough defenses in place to block their hacking they are able to just hire
an insider for.

I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôm not letting this country goto ruin while I‚Äôm
alive‚Äînot on my watch. It‚Äôs the least we could do for all those who came
before us.

The mechanisms our adversaries used to get us to the brink happen to be
pretty easy to reverse if we just focus our efforts, call out anybody being
deliberately divisive, and if we simply remain united‚Äîand if we return to
the land of facts being paramount and propaganda being forbidden to the
dust heap of history.


As of March 20, 2022We need to support Ukraine üá∫üá¶

We need to start thinking 2-3 steps ahead. We need to set Ukraine up for
success regardless of what Russia thinks. Ukraine‚Äôs success is our success.
Stop letting everything play out on Russia‚Äôs timeline. Let‚Äôs create our own
timeline. I hope we are getting Ukraine what they need now while we still
can. It‚Äôs tough. But I really do feel Russia has something else in the
works. Like they are purposely creating outrage and it‚Äôs possible they are
not accomplishing their publicly defined goals in a timely manner for a
reason possibly to give them time to exploit our citizens reflexes, as
stated previously. They knew where Zelensky was a long time ago‚Äîthey have
almost just as advanced ballistic weaponry as we do‚Äîthere‚Äôs got to be more
to it than just that. Russia never just does one thing at a time. They
always set up like 2-3 things at a time‚Äîthey always set themselves up for
the future and nothing is ever as it may seem with them. Putin is planning
something big that could impact the whole world‚ÄîI just know it. They got so
many different secret weapons it‚Äôs insane. I read Russia never really
stopped with the cold war, they just fixed their wounds and began
preparations for the next round essentially. Russia is currently in the
driver's seat with this whole operation and we need to change that. We need
to start thinking outside the box like them. We need to start being more
secretive about things ourselves. That is one of the only downfalls to an
alliance that I can think of; it makes it hard to keep any strategic
defense plans secret. We need to start being more proactive instead of just
reactive.



Potential Russian Mafia ‚ÄúSignals‚Äù

You‚Äôve got to consider what else was going on in the world at the time and whom
Russia might have been trying to send signals to in order to see a
potential correlation. Not all of them were likely caused by Russia but
some of them definitely could have been.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1681124/plane-carrying-132-crashes-in-china-shocked-xi-jinping-orders-probe


God, this is making me scared to fly. I have no doubt Russia could be
responsible for more than one of these using its proxies given its
obsession with both ‚Äúsignals‚Äù and ‚Äúexploiting vulnerabilities‚Äù. That and
its obsession with dancing around ‚Äúred lines‚Äù. These guys are killers you
guys‚Äìthey enjoy killing and getting away with it‚Äìespecially when signals
can be sent while doing it. They are ruthless. They do shit in ways that
allow plausible deniability. Meaning in ways that provide them with cover.
Meaning you‚Äôd have to dig deep as hell and have reasoning to suspect foul
play to ever even have a chance at catching them and successfully
prosecuting them for it‚Äìthen you‚Äôd need to dig even deeper to uncover the
ties to Russia with uncooperative Putin proxies/witnesses. (The
proxies/witnesses are uncooperative because they themselves are scared for
retaliation more so than any penalty they‚Äôd receive from our justice
system) This is fundamentally how Russia operates across the board. They
have become extremely effective at what they do.

You guys I think these guys worship satan. Isn‚Äôt there some reference to
brothers in regards to satan? Maybe that‚Äôs why both my brother and Putin
are both going after their brothers. There‚Äôs a ton of other parallels to
satan I can think of too. The perfect circles of black feathers left in my
yard previously could represent some black magic or ritual. Their obsession
with fireworks seemingly used as some kind of a ritual or offering to satan
prior to their killings, etc, etc. You guys seriously need to arrest my
brother before he kills anybody else. And we seriously need to take out the
kremlin before they bring about the apocalypse. They are acting incompetent
right now intentionally btw. Think back to the ‚ÄúArt of War‚Äù quotes. (
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lK0mGt9S44aFu39nnGZ6ZRYl57FW8IbhYzPjAzWHylE/edit#heading=h.tkub716t2odj
) That‚Äôs exactly what they want us to think. After a certain point it
becomes ridiculous to think any world power could really be that
incompetent‚Äìlet alone Putin who is known for his planning and intelligence.
Don‚Äôt fall for it. Anything that seems too good to be true probably is.
It‚Äôs just like when they do something that seems blatantly obvious with me
but in reality nothing they ever do is blatantly obvious and so whatever
seems blatantly obvious is likely meant as a false flag operation instead.
It‚Äôs hard as hell to truly catch them making any mistake‚Äìbelieve me. And
you‚Äôll know it when you do. I‚Äôve gotten one hidden camera video of them
throughout this whole ordeal thus far that I‚Äôm aware of for instance. I‚Äôm
still working on combing through some of my other hidden camera footage
tho, they are able to go through all my footage before I do even still tho
is the problem. And they have x-ray vision and they monitor me 24/7. So
they know where any hidden cameras are placed. I know it sounds crazy but I
promise you it‚Äôs the truth. That‚Äôs the real Russian intelligence agency
capabilities for you..

Water Tampering

I suspect the attackers have been tampering with my water. I suspected this
a long time ago tbh‚ÄìI stopped drinking my water a while ago now for this
reason‚Äìbut they are still doing it and I fear they are now adding something
that may be meant to get to me just through exposure to my bath water now.
Previously I would develop these strange abscesses and I ended up narrowing
it down to my drinking of my water‚Äìso I stopped drinking it. They always
use substances that are impossible to test for and they set up their
delivery system to be automated and digitized just like with everything
else they do. (So they can begin to inject their substances into my water
heater when they know I‚Äôm about to take a shower, etc, etc, so as to not
waste whatever it is‚ÄìI always hear them messing with my water heater
whenever I‚Äôm about to get in the shower as of lately‚Äìand my skin has
reacted multiple times after showering recently as well) I don‚Äôt even know
if you could even find a test for whatever it is they are adding to my
water‚Äìbelieve me‚ÄìI bought tests. Everything they do is engineered and
carried out in a way where the probability of them getting away with it is
extremely high. They take that shit into consideration beforehand, like in
regards to what is most likely to be tested for, etc, etc.

More on the Microchips

That‚Äôs right, I've now figured out that it‚Äôs not just one microchip it is
indeed the ‚Äúsmart dust‚Äù or multiple graphene nanochips at different levels
throughout my left ear. (Which they actually indicated to me previously
when I was looking into smart dust previously, but I‚Äôve since confirmed
that for myself) I have now narrowed it down to indeed be multiple graphene
nanochips that respond to ultrasound between the frequencies of 17,000hz
and ~19,500hz. I have attempted to disable them both using an EMP generator
device and using a red laser.

The results from my EMP generator trials were essentially I was able to
generate some minor EMPs that did somewhat affect other devices like my
ipad‚ÄìI haven‚Äôt tuned it well enough yet to get it to actually kill my
ipad‚Äìbut it was messing with my ipad‚Äìand then I measured the EF/EMF/RF
output of the EMP device and it turns out the EF/EMF/RF readings being
generated by my EMP device to try and disable the microchips was no greater
than the freaking EF/EMF/RF intensities that I have caught them freaking
EMF-ing me at from long range distances themselves. Meaning if their damn
EMF‚Äôs aren‚Äôt going to disable the microchips when they EMF me
constantly‚Äìthen I now have little hope my EMP device will disable their
microchips given they are both acting on the same forces essentially, and
given I don‚Äôt know how to exponentially increase the intensities beyond
what they are already hitting me with, if that makes sense? But I‚Äôm not
giving up. I could just need to fine tune it in the right way or something,
I did seem to get their nanochips to reset or go offline temporarily
however on at least one occasion‚ÄîI‚Äôve got to do more research and
experimenting I think.

In regards to my laser trials in an attempt to disable the microchips, I
did the research and found out the laser I would need either had to be a
red laser or NIR/IR laser in order to successfully penetrate my skin to get
down to the microchips to even have a chance at disabling them that way. So
that‚Äôs what I bought. What happened when I tried it was well for one‚ÄìI
could tell whenever I was hitting one of their damn microchips because the
laser isn‚Äôt even hot on my skin otherwise‚Äìbut whenever I would pass over
one of their nanochips I could feel it heat up under my skin quickly and I
could actually feel the laser under my skin get hot. Which makes sense cuz
a side effect of graphene is it can get really hot and so what happens when
I hit them with the red laser is they get really hot and I can actually
feel the difference quite noticeably; however, again they have been able to
get their damn microchips to be hotter ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù than I was able to
with my red laser itself, thus far anyways. Remember when I said I knew
where the microchip was because it got really hot on the tip of my
fingernail when plugging my ear with my finger previously? Yea, well that
was just during ‚Äúnormal operations‚Äù when they were tracking me driving and
they got it hotter than I have been able to get it thus far with my laser.
I‚Äôm still iterating on this method as well however. (While keeping safety
in mind)

I know there are multiple nanochips at different levels throughout my ear
now because of the ‚Äúgetting hot‚Äù and feeling where the red laser encounters
hot spots reason and because when I put in an earplug it doesn‚Äôt fully
block out all of the sound/signal of the microchips to my eardrum, meaning
there are likely multiple microchips some deeper than others through my
inner ear. It‚Äôs all on my left ear only. Another option I might try, and I
actually had to do this originally to get the damn things to not give me a
heart attack after I got my second covid shot‚Äì-is to take some different
dosages of aspirin to try and get them to go further through my bloodstream
out of reach of my ear which acts as a natural antenna topology for the
microchips. Meaning if I could just get them to flow a little further maybe
they would then go out of reach from the outside world‚Äìhowever then I‚Äôd be
potentially risking a stroke or other bad brain injury‚Äìjust from taking
aspirin. If you have any other ideas please let me know. I‚Äôve got to do
what the attackers do and research all the strengths and weaknesses except
in regards to unwanted graphene nanochips‚Äìwhich there is virtually no data
on‚Äìbut I have been researching the strengths and weaknesses of graphene
itself. And then I need to take all those findings and figure out the best
way to disable the graphene in my ear without hurting myself‚Äìif it‚Äôs even
possible. So it‚Äôs kinda like hacking in a way. I got to find the
vulnerabilities and exploit them to my advantage to be free again
essentially.. (And exploiting how graphene gets hot is one such way, I also
considered hitting them with the laser and getting them hot then
photographing my ear using a infrared camera so I could then get someone to
operate and get them out‚Äìbut thus far I haven‚Äôt been able to get them hot
enough to show up as a big enough difference in the infrared camera‚Äìhowever
this may be my best path forward)

If you have any other bright ideas please let me know. üôè Seriously you
guys‚ÄìI really could use some help with this one‚ÄìI have literally no chance
of escaping them otherwise.

One final note‚Äîwell two final notes. If the attackers were really that
close to defeating us, then these guys wouldn‚Äôt be so worried about hiding
stuff to avoid getting caught anymore. Meaning they are at least still
concerned about the next few years of the potential for them to get locked
up and prosecuted I would think. Therefore we still have time based on my
calculations. Lastly, I was going to say I no longer think China is working
hand in hand with the Russian Mafia to do this horrible shit to us but then
I realized I was too quick to jump to conclusions after feeling bad for
them for that plane crash today. You never know if China is ultimately like
Russia and willing to stage shit against its own citizens in order to gain
strategic advantages itself. So I still don‚Äôt know how much of all this is
China at this point. It might just be more concerned than Russia to hide
its inner selves. Only time will tell. (Everyone knows Russia is brutal
now, but China üá®üá≥ is still a tbd‚Äîthey could just be playing good cop üëÆ
bad cop üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è still‚Äîbut in reverse this time)

My superpowerüí™ === Ability to see through people üëì

It‚Äôs a good superpower to have especially during these trying times.. You
all can do it too, you just got to think and make determinations based on
patterns and probabilities like me, and research a ton of shit whenever you
get the chance. Add in continuous learning and the studying of
competition‚Äîregardless of whether you are on top or not. And a sprinkle of
being willing to admit when you are wrong and always being willing to
change your mind if the bulk of the evidence permits. Plus
reading/listening to a book or two on psychology and manipulation is a must
in this day and age. Then practice makes perfect as with anything. üòâ Hard
work and determination too I guess. Lose your ego. Ask good questions. Be
honest. Don‚Äôt be afraid to stand up for what is right. Have a little
integrity. And utilize common sense. But yea, that‚Äôs really all there is to
it.

What‚Äôs probably better anyways is if we all team up and use our own unique
super powers to compliment each other and fight back together to retain our
freedom. What is your super power?

As of March 22, 2022Status Update

I‚Äôll try to keep it short.

I went to the doctor today and they didn‚Äôt say anything about my drug test
so I‚Äôm assuming that was another attempt from the attackers at discrediting
me and/or another false flag operation the other day. Meaning the attackers
didn‚Äôt tamper with my drug test that I‚Äôm aware of after all. Keep in mind
though that the attackers always do shit that is like uncomfortable for
both parties, so it‚Äôs possible the hackers did mess with my doctor‚Äôs
systems and my doctor‚Äôs office figured it out‚Äìidk‚Äìprobably not‚Äìbut it‚Äôs
possible. If that did happen would they want to say anything about it to
me? Probably not. But for now I‚Äôll just assume that was another false flag
operation on the attackers part, my doctor‚Äôs systems are NOT hacked, for
the sake of not making them look bad, and yea my drug test was as expected.
But to be clear‚ÄìDO NOT let that make you think for even a second that these
guys don‚Äôt have the capabilities of hacking anybody and everybody‚Äìbecause
they do‚Äìand they pretty much already have.

I didn‚Äôt mean to come off wrong on the investigation assumptions piece, to
be clear‚ÄìI have no insight into what the police are doing whatsoever beyond
my intuition‚Äìthat was just both an opinion and a warning just incase they
are digging deeper into some of the people around here. Like I just want
people to do the right thing that‚Äôs all. I am pretty confident that the
feds are aware of what is going on, and i‚Äôm pretty confident that they are
looking into some of this stuff because for one they have access to this
information just like you do and for two because this is all a pretty
freaking big deal if I am right about even half of it, especially once it
begun involving things like our most advanced fighter jet aircraft taking
part in an assault against me to send our government a signal in regards to
the war in Ukraine‚ÄìI would think that would be at least worth them looking
into how our own military might be rebelling like that and whatnot. And I
can totally see how in order for these guys to have gotten this far, it
would almost have to be more widespread around the broader population
around here, etc, etc. Plus I share this info with my elected
representatives regularly. And I even started following anonymous on
twitter lately and presented them with this information as well, because
they are known to help people like me who are being gangstalked; and plus,
based on some forums I‚Äôve read, anonymous is in fact at least loosely
intertwined with the feds‚Äìwhich is a good thing in my view. It‚Äôs kinda like
how Russia does it with supporting their local hackers. But I don‚Äôt think
anonymous looked into more than just my network and just briefly and
recently‚ÄìI provided them this info because they specifically stated they
were going to start going after Russian hackers and so I told them I have
an in to some Russian hackers. And to be clear, it might not even be the
feds who I suspect I‚Äôve seen on my computer alongside my brother and the
Russians malware previously‚Äìit may be our actual military. And one more
thing I need to clear up, it‚Äôs possible Russia got their malware from
Isreal and not from our government, and it‚Äôs possible that‚Äôs why Isreal is
still all buddy buddy with Russia. Israel is known for developing super
advanced malware and selling it for tons of money to foreign countries. But
regardless, I‚Äôm telling you that both our government‚Äôs malware and the
attacker‚Äôs malware are very alike‚Äìand I‚Äôm absolutely positive these guys
have managed to steal at least some of our trade secrets previously. P.s. I
do sometimes fear with all their manipulation that they may have played man
in the middle and intercepted some of my key communications to some of our
officials‚Äìso I do worry about that as well. Because they do do that on
other things. But if they did do that when sharing this with our officials
then they snuck it past me. Before I leave I plan to ask you all who are
reading this to share parts of this that you find compelling with our
government officials yourselves just so I can feel like I have literally
done everything and so I can rest assured that our government has been
notified. I think that would also be cool to see what you guys think is
most compelling and to have it put in your own words to them.

Okay so with that said, I realize it goes both ways and this shit is
concerning to you guys in regards to my mental state as well. I want to
give you guys the peace of mind that I am now confident they can‚Äôt just
completely take over my mind and go out and make me like start shooting
people or anything like that. I think that happens more to people who they
are able to slowly convince that either it‚Äôs like the devil or demons or
something doing this all to them‚Äìand not a series of microchips + a foreign
adversary + a murderous brother. They may also be successful in coercing a
target individual to go lash out against the broader society to people whom
just aren‚Äôt as intelligent as I am and/or people who aren‚Äôt able to get as
far as I have gotten in figuring all this stuff out. (Including who the
real bad guys are and why they may actually benefit from doing this shit to
people within our country, etc, etc) Most people aren‚Äôt as technically
savvy as I am either. And even with those people who they are able to ‚Äútake
over their minds‚Äù they don‚Äôt really take over their minds like a first
person shooter game, it‚Äôs more like they are able to slowly convince them
over time that the world is against them, their government is against them,
and stuff like that to where ultimately they end up radicalizing the
individual and pushing them to do something that ultimately contributes to
undermining our country vs actively controlling them through it. If that
makes sense? I meant for this section to make you feel better, I know it
probably didn‚Äôt hit the mark, but my point is that if nothing else just
know that I know what these guys want more than anything is to undermine
our country and to discredit me and whatnot‚Äìand so I am extremely resistant
to doing what it is they may want me to do. If I did that then I‚Äôd be no
better than my brother and I‚Äôd actually undermine everything I‚Äôve been
fighting for previously. Plus, they can‚Äôt control me. They can try. They do
try. But they have failed and they will continue to fail. In addition, have
comfort in the fact that people are watching over me already is what I was
getting at as well. If I fell for these guys‚Äô attempts to undermine our
society in such a gruesome manner‚Äìthat would be the worst possible outcome
in my mind‚Äìeven beyond just getting killed myself. However to be clear, I
may still fall for their attempts to undermine our society without knowing
it in other ways, like for instance maybe they want me to share this
information publicly to undermine our allies faith in us, etc, etc. But
what I can promise you is I won‚Äôt fall for their attempts to undermine us
in the way we all may be thinking in the back of our minds. Some people
don‚Äôt even know who or why this is even being done to them, etc, and others
might simply mistake it for god or demons or something like that. None of
those things are the case with me. These guys are very versatile, they
constantly adapt as stated previously, so they are able to just adapt and
coerce people in the way they want them to go based on whatever it is that
that person may believe‚Äìbut that doesn‚Äôt work so well when you know their
ultimate goal is to destabilize our society however necessary. The brain is
a neural network like I said, and even though sometimes I may get
frustrated and feel like some people might be against me‚ÄìI will never
forget who is the one who is pulling the strings behind the scenes and I
will never forget that they are trying to use me to further destabilize our
country. What I can promise is I will never lose my moral compass and I‚Äôll
always try to do the right thing. What I can‚Äôt promise however is like I
might not be able to stop them from using me to get to more of our hackers
or something like that‚Äìeven though I‚Äôve been trying to even stop shit like
that‚ÄìI assure you.

That‚Äôs enough for today, while I have more I want to say, I‚Äôll save it for
a day when I have less to talk about. I need to keep these shorter going
forward. I also need to take all this info and create a nice organized
summary which simply refers back to these bigger docs for brevity reasons,
and make it easier for people reading to soak in all the key points without
getting into all the details, etc. One more thing, I added a motion
detection sensor to my attic after hearing shit moving around up there and
my alarm was set off this morning around 7:30am while I was asleep via that
motion sensor in the attic. No idea what happened. I didn‚Äôt even hear it or
know my alarm had been triggered until I woke up later.

Hacker People

Hey you hacker people‚Äìplease don‚Äôt underestimate these guys‚Äô ability to
even somehow implant malware into this very google docs file somehow that
is somehow able to infect you without your even downloading it. I have
given up on thinking I might know what is hackable and what is not at this
point. These guys have completely blown me away with their capabilities
time and time again. I honestly can‚Äôt even think of a better way to share
this info without the possibility of them somehow jerry rigging something
or other to potentially pose a threat to other people‚Äôs devices anymore.
Github markdown readme maybe? They got so many 0days‚Äìit‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôve been
meaning to move everything to github anyways, for the version history. But
yea, I just don‚Äôt want them to use me to further destabilize our society so
I‚Äôm just trying to be extra cautious that‚Äôs all. I have no knowledge of
them being able to do what I just said btw, I just fear the worst and try
to use my intelligence and then I hope for the best that‚Äôs all. I work on
moving all this to github just to be safe.. (For real this time, sorry guys
I have a huge backlog of things that can be done‚Äìit‚Äôs all a matter of what
takes the most priority) Or perhaps more realistically‚Äìbe careful when
clicking on any links located in the google doc file to sites that aren‚Äôt
well known. So like that link to 1920.in for instance. I swear to god that
one is a trap. They can do shit like this just from you visiting a website:
(Again, be careful)

http://samy.pl/webscan/

https://samy.pl/natpin/

That samy guy is good btw. And that‚Äôs without any super sophisticated 0days
just found on the internet by me one day when looking around recently‚ÄìI
actually found it by digging deeper into one of the rf hacking youtube
videos I shared previously‚Äìand these guys actually have 0days‚Äìseemingly a
lot of them‚ÄìI assure you. If I weren‚Äôt completely gangstalked and whatnot
right now‚ÄìI‚Äôd work on developing some sort of tool for the average
person/hacker to be able to tell whether or not they are hacked using
everything from scanning of internal and external networks to port
monitoring to arp monitoring to packet monitoring and replay functionality
to machine learning to easy setup without having to be a freaking security
expert to behavioral analysis to‚Äìyou know just like a kick ass all
encompassing intrusion detection/prevention system geared towards the home
user‚Äìwithout dollar signs being the motive behind it like every other
vendor does‚Äìin reality the motive behind it would be straight up freedom
and to help save our country. I could still charge for it but the
difference is every other company who develops something that nice ends up
only targeting huge corporations with their products‚Äìleaving us normal
people exposed‚Äìand us normal people is who Russia primarily seems to be
trying to corrupt and manipulate‚Äìin addition to all the corporations but
they get in through people like us. But yea, it‚Äôs on my bucket list ;)

My Brother

If you want to go into the belly of the beast and if you want to attempt to
hack my brother, his name is Dustin Timothy Bay and he lives at 3655 S 635
W Ogden, UT 84405. Not suggesting you should‚Äìjust sayin. I only say this
because like I just found out even my yubikey can technically be hacked
which just makes it so like literally everything can be hacked‚ÄìI‚Äôm not
saying they have succeeded in hacking my yubikey cuz apparently it can take
up to 10 hours of them having access to your yubikey per account to hack
but that was my main last hope and finding that out just barely is just
devastating. It means if they did so then all my stuff I worked so hard to
prevent them from accessing‚Äìthey could still access. And it just makes it
so literally everything is so heavily weighted towards the hackers over the
hackees in every single case‚Äìeven that much more now. Even a super skilled
hacker can be hacked regardless of their defenses is what I‚Äôm saying. And I
promise you these guys got some really good malware. Multiple 0days if I
had to guess‚Äìand that‚Äôs not even exaggerating. They are working on behalf
of Russia too based on everything I have found, which is also a pretty big
incentive I might add. Plus you might help save our country like
for-real‚Äìand I know I would appreciate no longer being gangstalked anymore
that‚Äôs for damn sure. But yea, be super careful and use like layers and
layers of anonymity if you do. Last I was aware of he uses Macs. Just fyi..
If I weren‚Äôt in this position that;s what I‚Äôd do‚Äìcuz it‚Äôs like you not only
get access to all his automated 0day malware but you get access to
everything he has gotten access to previously‚Äìwhich is a lot I‚Äôm telling
you. It‚Äôs like you jump from a small fish to a megalodon in the ocean just
like that. He probably tries to keep his most valuable stuff pretty hidden
and out of sight tho. I cannot be held liable if you do, I'm just
fantasizing that‚Äôs all.. :)

As of March 24, 2022

They ‚Äúbaked‚Äù me again last night. I can feel the ‚Äúsun burn‚Äù on the lower
part of my body which wasn‚Äôt protected by lead as I slept. They are trying
to give me cancer. They seem to want me to go after my brother. Probably
because he knows he‚Äôs fucked at this point.


Doing the Unthinkable

[Brainstorming]

Seems how someone seemingly shared this with some of our allies, might as
well make the most of it.

Alright guys here is the situation as I now see it.

Things are kinda going the way I thought. Zelensky is now questioning
whether or not NATO can ‚Äúmaintain world peace‚Äù--and I don‚Äôt blame him.

There‚Äôs a few ways I can see us looking at this. For one, we‚Äôve got to
realize we can‚Äôt trust everybody anymore because Russia and China have
gotten a head start on us in doing shit the easy way, the incremental way.
(i.e. they‚Äôve been corrupting our citizens incrementally‚Äìwhich is a lot
less traumatic than like a full blown war‚Äìbut ultimately it is just as
effective long-term as full blown war nonetheless) As for me I mean I‚Äôm
totally trying to do what‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm not an actor, I‚Äôve never been an
actor, but even still they may manipulate me in ways which make me respond
in ways meant to manipulate you in ways of their choosing. So we got to
look out for that. That could be the same thing that‚Äôs happening to
Ukraine, idk. I get the sense it is a very similar situation playing out
with Ukraine where they are essentially ‚Äúgangstalking‚Äù Ukraine, and Ukraine
isn‚Äôt acting, but even still Ukraine‚Äôs reactions are going to be
predictable from the attackers perspective. And they are simply exploiting
their reactions to show the world NATO can‚Äôt keep us safe using reflexive
control.

So what do we do about it?

Well like I said we are behind. The best thing would have been to
incrementally corrupt the communist leaders and whatnot as well a long time
ago. And just to be clear I can‚Äôt be the one who comes up with the ultimate
solution because whatever I come up with they‚Äôll just begin to watch out
for and block. But I do want to use this opportunity to at least come up
with some ideas.

Alright so just to get this out of the way, Russia has some of the most
advanced electromagnetic control weapons on the planet and they are able to
essentially make us all be more docile or more aggressive using their
electromagnetic control weapons without us even knowing it‚Äìso we need to
watch out for that. I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. (Elaborate on previous video
shared here and how all our cells can be impacted using electrical signals)

What they are tapping into is literally like evolution on a cellular level.
It impacts how all our cells function. We are fundamentally energy and the
particles in us are mostly made up of air and the electromagnetic
properties of electrons and protons within our atoms. That‚Äôs something my
brother actually taught me previously. (I probably didn‚Äôt say it correctly
but hopefully you get the point) Bottom line is Russia also now has this
extremely effective long range mind control weapon‚Äìthat has been proven to
be able to impact people‚Äôs desires to even want to live or not from what I
gather. And during a trial run previously some organization in Canada
actually tracked it being used against certain citizens within the US and
Canada from across the globe. And therefore we just need to be cognizant of
the potential that Putin is directing these electromagnetic fields at our
populations on purpose, particularly anybody who is hacked, and
intentionally sending these waves our way to make us feel down and/or feel
like not wanting to fight back. These Russians love mind control that‚Äôs for
damn sure‚Äìand that‚Äôs one form of mind control that can be used on a broad
level.

But yea, in my view, we first define the problem and the constraints.
Here‚Äôs a preliminary attempt at me doing so. We need to figure out how to
deal with the existing corruptees in our countries without tearing
ourselves apart, we need to figure out how to close off all the ways the
Russians are getting in to manipulate and corrupt more and more of our
citizens, we also need to figure out how we can effectively exploit them
back, we need to figure out how to best combat the present threat to the
global order, (aka how to save Ukraine) we need to figure out how to remain
united despite the inevitable reflexes Ukraine is going to go through, we
need to figure out how to do so in a way that doesn‚Äôt make communism look
like the saving grace, and we need to figure out how to then make sure this
never happens again.

As for closing off ways they are getting in, we have become a little too
open and they are exploiting that fact, if you picture a bell curve with
total communism on the left and total freedom on the right we need to go a
little more to the center. Or at very least we need to do more to make it
harder for ppl to create new social media accounts without any real
verification. Or else we need to make laws that require companies to make
their platforms so that strategic adversarial abuse is not possible.

When you think about it‚Äìthey have to corrupt literally everybody whereas we
just have to corrupt a small few. But the problem is if they have corrupted
even one person who is critical to a certain vote for instance, then they
can throw off that whole vote in their favor.

Technically we are a lot alike on the levels lower than the main heads of
state. Like I‚Äôm sure a lot of Russian companies also hold votes and whatnot
and could theoretically be corrupted in the same ways as our companies‚Äìvote
or no vote‚Äìeverybody likes money and doesn‚Äôt want to go public with the
fact that they‚Äôve been hacked/exploited. And if we corrupted a bunch of
their companies then we could theoretically get to a point where we could
begin to impact their heads of state‚Äìbut targeting oligarchs might be a
quicker path. The only problem is time. They have a head start on us and it
takes time. So that won‚Äôt work right now, but it is a valuable lesson for
the future.

Media is key in both societies and I have seen how we‚Äôve been going after
their media lately which is a plus.

One idea I have is to start treating them like the alliance they are and to
start punishing them accordingly. China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. For
the actions of one we punish all of them.

We need to exploit communism. How might we exploit communism? And in short
order? While staying united? And maintaining our reputation in the world?

The only way out right now that I can see is if we go to war. That will
keep us united. That will avoid the world from losing faith in whether or
not we can keep it safe. Plus we have an advantage if we go to war with
them in that our conventional military is better than theirs. It will make
it so people actually want to fight. It will make it so all the proxies
won‚Äôt want to support Russia anymore‚Äìor else they‚Äôll be forced to choose.
The ‚Äúsafe‚Äù way in this case is a losing way. We are too behind already. We
can‚Äôt win going the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù route at this stage. We can‚Äôt lock up half our
population after all‚Äìthat would rip us apart. We need to figure out a way
to get the proxies to not want to be proxies regardless of cost any longer.
We‚Äôve got to change up the game to what we know best and tilt the board in
our favor by making them fight our more dominant military vs allowing them
to continue exploiting our citizens. Yea theoretically it could end in the
end of the world but I don‚Äôt think China would allow that. This is just me
brainstorming, please work with me..

We‚Äôve got to do what‚Äôs never been done before and goto war against a rival
nuke holder to get out of this mess we are in‚Äîregardless of whether it is
on the other side of the planet or not. World war is world war‚Äîit takes
place globally. Plus if we are really all ‚Äúone‚Äù under nato, that means this
really is all taking place at our doorstep already.

I can‚Äôt say that we will still be the top country once the war is over due
to potential inflation, but I do think we will have a lot better odds at
still being one of the top countries. Whereas if we continue on the path we
are on‚ÄîI have no doubt the communists will ensure we are nowhere near the
top country when it‚Äôs all said and through. I‚Äôd much rather have a Britain
style ending to global dominance vs some other global power‚Äôs ending whose
ending came about from straight up defeat by a completely different
ideology.

It really is democracies vs communism. Do you really think if the
communists win they will allow a single democracy that is not just a puppet
democracy going forward? Yea right. Communists are ruthless. They are
murderers. They side with criminals. They seek power and world domination.
Maybe we should start being just as aggressive as they are.

When you think of our global order in the future, say 200-2k years from
now, what do you picture? Do you picture more like the dune type emperor or
do you picture something else? Those types of questions are being answered
right now. Because either the communists will win and we will likely remain
communist for pretty much forever or else democracies will win and with any
luck, we will implement new laws and education and whatnot which ensures
not only that foreign agents can‚Äôt be elected president, we will teach all
our citizens up on psychology and manipulation so we will be able to see
through all their manipilation going forward, (it‚Äôs not just about
nazi-ism‚Äìit‚Äôs about psychology and manipulation and exploiting weaknesses,
etc) with any luck we will forever remember just how close we came to
losing our freedom and we will hopefully then have enough precedent to
truly ensure this never happens again. We would also win over some of the
existing smaller communist societies or just do away with them altogether
this time seems that‚Äôs what they want to do with us. (By do away with them
I mean force democracy upon them to prevent them from trying to take over
the world ever again‚Äìby them doing away with us I mean they legit want to
do away with us) And then you might picture some highly intelligent alien
democratic order in the future from now, what movie shows that future
instead? I know there‚Äôs at least some movies that show democratic orders in
the future, I‚Äôm just not good with movies and I‚Äôve seen dune recently. Oh I
think Star Wars, some of those sects have democratic orders. Even on dune
the good guys were I think democracies.

This really is good vs evil. And we really might have to consider doing the
unthinkable at this stage.

Joe Biden even actually finally said it today‚ÄìPutin has his eyes on us. And
I guarantee you Putin is working on behalf of China because Russia is in no
position to lead the world order going forward. Nobody uses their currency.
Best case for them is they become China‚Äôs ‚ÄúOligarch‚Äù or a China ally with
special privileges as I said.. Even though Russia is pretty much the
mastermind behind all of this.

https://www.c-span.org/video/?518970-1/president-biden-meeting-eu-council-president


What might be best is to divide their ‚Äúshadow alliance‚Äù to get a leg up in
this ‚Äúshadow war‚Äù. You know, the alliance among Russia, China, North Korea,
and Iran. Divide them like they are trying to do to NATO currently. One way
to do this is to point out the fact that best case scenario Russia will
still only be China‚Äôs bitch. (Excuse my language‚Äìjust making a point)

We could also exploit the fact that the right in our country literally
hates China, thanks in part to Russia and their little ‚Äúgood cop, bad cop‚Äù
skits.. So just informing the right that they are really working on behalf
of China would be huge. (i.e. Make them regret their past manipulations of
our people lol)

All I‚Äôm saying is if we are going to act we might as well do it while
Ukrainians are still with us. Because they are pretty badass and they are
truly legendary. If they get defeated then morale is going to plummet
across the world big time. I really do feel they are completely genuine as
hell and they are fighting this war for freedom for all of us right now.

P.s. Some people have already been corrupted‚Äìon all sides and likely within
key positions within all of our countries‚Äìplease remember that. The average
joe who has been corrupted isn‚Äôt the worst person in the world either, they
just were exploited and forced to choose between either their own well
being or else the well being of the group‚Äìand they just so happened to put
themselves first that‚Äôs all. That‚Äôs why we could all learn quite a bit from
Ukraine tbh. We need to stop putting ourselves first and it would break the
spell. We need to lead by example with NATO and put NATO first and our own
countries second‚Äìnot just in words but in actions. You can tell this is
what Russia fears the most because there has even been a new right-wing
talking point that has surfaced recently about the ‚Äúnew world order‚Äù--which
is completely not based in fact. That video I shared previously about
changing world orders and China being next is actually based in fact. I
think the right is referring to NATO being the new world order or
something. Which just doesn‚Äôt make any damn sense. NATO has been around for
decades. Again, they are accusing others of that which they plan to do
themselves.

We need to start thinking of our countries and our people like they are
computer systems that need protected. And propaganda and misinformation and
whatnot as viruses that need to be exterminated. That‚Äôs how Russia and
China view their countries and their people from what I gather. (Except we
shouldn‚Äôt go as far as they have gone‚Äìlike they could care less about their
people) But the protection part is key because society as a whole is very
much like a computer network or information system.

Russia is Root of ALL Our Problems

Russia can even use its secret electromagnetic weapon to start wildfires
from across the globe apparently. üî• üî• Supposedly they can even use it as
a kind of shield. (Not sure how effective it is tho) Have you ever wondered
whether someone is deliberately starting some of these wildfires in
California/the western US? I have. The fires in California even affect us
in Utah like hardcore. I‚Äôm telling you guys that Russia is at the root of
all of our problems as a country. From all these mass shootings to funding
organized crime to funding terrorists to gangstalking our people to
silencing our whistleblowers to likely some of the planes/helicopters that
crash to corrupting our people to dividing our people to corrupting some of
our military to starting wildfires to placing bombs in parks to providing
hitman for hire services to the insurrection‚ÄîRussia has played a role in
all of it. What is even left that has been an issue lately? Hurricanes? Who
the fuck knows whether their secret global electromagnetic weapon is
partially responsible for those as well. There seems to be a lot more
hurricanes that hit us than any other country lately I will say that. We‚Äôve
got to get to the root of some of these issues otherwise we‚Äôll just keep
having to endure more and more hardship.

They finally admitted it. Russia has implanted malware into some of our
systems. I just saw them admit it. Thank you. Yea it sucks but the first
step to solving any problem is recognizing the fact that it exists.

You guys‚ÄìRussia is planning something big‚ÄìI just know it. When the threat
of nukes stops countries from responding with their conventional militaries
in times of conflict‚Äìthat means we have got to invest more in non
conventional military techniques‚Äìjust like Russia has apparently been doing
for a long time. Cuz otherwise we are left almost completely defenseless
and unable to maintain world order.

As of March 26, 2022Gangstalking

Alright so imagine this.

Seriously imagine this and think about each of these things next time you
are doing the same thing yourself.

It‚Äôs difficult for me to look and behave normally these days for the
following reasons.

Okay so imagine the prospect of getting in the shower. You‚Äôve got to get in
the shower. To most people, it‚Äôs no big deal. To me‚Äîit is a huge freaking
deal as with everything. Imagine using your body wash not knowing whether
or not there is some substance added in there meant to do harm to you and
which gives you hives. Same for your shampoo. Same for the very water
coming out of the spout itself. Same for the bathtub itself. Same for the
floor leading up to the bathtub. Imagine doing everything in your power to
ensure you don‚Äôt have to worry about all this shit going forward only to
have every single thing you do be countered and them getting past your most
stringent countermeasures regardless of what you do. They are trying to
make me look like I don‚Äôt shower with this one‚Äîby making it difficult as
hell to shower and by putting poison shit in all my body washes, etc, to
where I am actually negatively reinforced whenever I do shower unless I do
literally everything right including buying brand new soap and body wash
right before I shower or else using brand new soap and body wash that is
clear that it hasn‚Äôt been tampered with previously. I‚Äôve been buying the
personal ones lately, but even with a lot of those, there‚Äôs no seal.
Meaning they can still tamper with brand new body washes before I ever use
them‚Äìeven if I store them in my safe.

Imagine brushing your teeth and having it hurt your teeth more than it
helps. This one has a direct link back to my brother‚Äìhe was accusing my mom
of something similar but in reality he was telling me what he was going to
do to me come to find out. This one is meant to get me not to brush my
teeth or else face potential tooth loss if I do. (Unless I buy brand new
sealed toothpaste and toothbrush each time which I‚Äôve been trying to do)

Imagine putting everything in your brand new 3rd safe you just bought. Safe
right? Wrong. They use their tunnel to get in and take a picture of my keys
when I‚Äôm busy in the other room and then they are able to 3d print keys to
access my safe while I‚Äôm away. And if I buy a combination safe they‚Äôll just
use their x-ray vision to watch the combination.

Now imagine the prospect of trying to find new fresh clothes and having to
worry about them tampering with those as well and putting this shit on them
that makes you break out in hives.

Imagine the prospect of taking a nap. Most people it‚Äôs no big deal. To me
if I take a nap without completely locking myself in my room and faraday
cage and triggers in place to tell whether they got in or not while I‚Äôm
asleep‚Äîthen it‚Äôs a potential death sentence for me. They will use their
electromagnetic energy weapon to change the polarity of my brain to sedate
me then they‚Äôll come get access to my prescriptions right out of my pocket
and tamper with them via their tunnel‚Äîand that‚Äôs assuming they‚Äôll even
allow me to fall asleep elsewhere in the first place. Sometimes they
deliberately try and make me fall asleep‚Äìother times they deliberately try
and keep me awake. Just depending on what it is they are trying to do at
the time and how exposed I am, etc, etc.

Imagine the prospect of using the restroom. Having to dodge their
deliberate attempts to target you whenever you use the restroom as if they
are trying to condition you not to eat anymore just so that you don‚Äôt have
to deal with their harassment when using the restroom as often. I think
they specifically target me while using the restroom both for the trying to
make me skinny reason and because that‚Äôs one of the reasons one wakes up at
nights randomly. So them getting the signatures of my brain needing to use
the restroom further ensures they won‚Äôt get caught when sedating me and
tampering with me during the nighttimes going forward essentially.

Imagine getting ready to leave the house. No big deal right? Wrong. Huge
freaking deal. I‚Äôve got to make sure literally everything is in place, and
half the time I encounter something or other that suggests they have
compromised another one of my countermeasures making it so I have to then
reset my phone or reset my network or reset my security system or buy a new
one just to have even like 50 percent confidence that they won‚Äôt get in my
house while I‚Äôm away, etc, etc.

Imagine trying to do everything in your power to keep them off your devices
only to fail every single time. Their malware I swear doesn‚Äôt even go away
when completely resetting the operating system. And whenever I do have a
new computer or what have you then they can just use their x-ray vision
and/or electromagnetic technology to view my keypresses/view my screen, and
when paired with their tunnel they can just get in and tamper with the
hardware directly in person‚Äìwhich no hardware can be immuned from direct
physical access.

Imagine doing everything in your power to disable their damn microchip(s)
to no avail.

Imagine going to sleep at night. No big deal right? Wrong. I‚Äôve got to
sleep in a faraday cage. I‚Äôve got to make sure my whole freaking house is
locked down. I‚Äôve got to make sure I am literally locked into my room with
triggers on the door to let me know if they get in while I‚Äôm asleep. I‚Äôve
got to make sure I am protected from their emf‚Äôs, gas, and infrasound‚Äìwhich
is impossible to be fully protected from all 3 btw. They‚Äôll even put their
poison shit on the sound proof foam to where if I fall asleep surrounded in
sound proof foam then I‚Äôll wake up with this strange substance on my hands
and arms and on any exposed skin essentially, which can give me hives as
well. I‚Äôve got to make sure they can‚Äôt access anything of value like my
prescriptions, vape juice, etc, etc, while I‚Äôm asleep, I‚Äôve got to try and
make sure they can‚Äôt make me sleep indefinitely nor keep me awake by
protecting myself sufficiently. I‚Äôve got to make sure my home security
alarm is on and not hacked so they don‚Äôt tamper with other parts of my
house while I‚Äôm asleep. Lately they‚Äôve even been triggering my home
security system intentionally to make it so it actually frustrates the
police. I‚Äôve got to make sure my regular alarm clocks are on and not
connected to the internet otherwise they can just disable them through all
their hacking while I‚Äôm asleep. I‚Äôve got to make sure they haven‚Äôt added
any new hardware to anything which doesn‚Äôt connect to the internet by
default which makes it so it is connected to the internet for their
tampering. I‚Äôve got to make sure I block all air gaps that sound can travel
through without suffocating myself, etc, etc.

Imagine the prospect of getting a new place to get away from their tunnel,
etc. No big deal right? Wrong. Huge freaking deal. For one they are all
over whatever it is I do. They rigged my whole rental house just in
anticipation of me possibly staying there before I rented it out again
previously. Plus if I rent any place out myself, I‚Äôm going to need advanced
locks in place just to keep them out‚Äîand not every landlord will be cool
with that. Just renting a place out seems like a huge challenge to me tbh.
They aim to essentially rig the whole place before I even officially rent
it out.

I guess I need to find a roommate is what I need. Someone renting just like
a single room out. And to disable their damn microchips still. But even
then they can just start EMF-ing me and make nobody want to be my roommate.
My brother has a history of doing shit like this to deliberately isolate
me. It‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs been planning on having me be his fall guy for at least
7 years. God it‚Äôs hard to do the right thing in this world.

Just while it‚Äôs on my mind, it‚Äôs very possible that they actually used a
satellite to superheat me right above where I sleep and then they just
instructed the jet to fly over while they used the satellite to heat me
previously, hence setting it up to where if investigated then I‚Äôll look
like the crazy one myself‚Äìwhen in reality the pilot is indeed colluding
with Russia. This is how they are able to get away with literally
everything. So from now on if I say oh a jet airplane emf‚Äôd me last night,
you can believe the part that a jet airplane deliberately flew over me‚Äìbut
start looking for other ways in which the emf itself happened. Same goes
for if I say this guy was acting all suspicious outside my house then when
I got home it smelled like weed. In reality that guy was acting all
suspicious outside my house and it did smell like weed when I got home
however it was specifically set up to make me look bad and it smelt like
weed in my home likely due to some gas or some capability they added to my
furnace previously. It was meant as a false flag in that case. So what I‚Äôm
getting at is they never make it simple or straightforward‚Äìthey always
deliberately make it look like it‚Äôs someone it‚Äôs not when in reality everyone
is in on it whether they realize it or not but they all only know their part.
(Besides the hackers‚Äìthe hackers know everything)

I am confident they have a tunnel btw, I‚Äôm going to be renting out a ground
penetrating radar soon to find their tunnel seems they can‚Äôt hide their
tunnel just cuz they know I‚Äôm going to be searching for it. Finding their
tunnel will also make it so I don‚Äôt have to bother renting another place
out. It will also lead us directly to the culprit if found.

Imagine the prospect of leaving your car and the possibility of them
getting inside it whenever they choose. I often leave my phone recording
these days in my car whenever I have any food or anything in there that I
don‚Äôt want them tampering with while I have to run into some other store
real quick‚Äîbut even then all my phones are hacked so they can still
technically get passed it.

Imagine everytime you go to eat a piece of candy that you didn‚Äôt finish
previously risking them having put something on it meant to harm you in
some way. Imagine everytime you go to go to the doctor anything you touch
you risk them potentially contaminating you with something meant to
discredit you if given a drug test at the doctor. Imagine anytime you go to
do any of your prescriptions or inhaler or vape juice you risk getting
cancer. This is meant to either discredit me or give me cancer.

Imagine anytime you go to sleep you risk getting cancer through their
targeting of you with cancer causing directed energy weapons all night.
This is meant to make me afraid to fall asleep.

It‚Äôs all designed to discredit me. From keeping me up at nights to making
me sleep forever when I do sleep even if I‚Äôm not tired to making it a bad
experience for me to shower to making me afraid to brush my teeth to making
it a bad experience for me to use the restroom to making it scary for me to
fall asleep to making it difficult for me to do literally anything to all
their false flag operations and continuous shenanigans, etc, etc. They are
extremely serious about discrediting me. I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt
discredited me more than they have tbh. They actually haven‚Äôt really
succeeded in discrediting me at all thus far. But they try that‚Äôs for damn
sure.

I could go on btw. But just know this is just the gist of it. The three
critical pieces to enable them to do all this is all their hacking, their
tunnel, and their microchips‚Äìoh and all the Russian proxies/their use of
psychology. If i can counter any one of those things it would honestly make
all of the difference.

I hope Russia hacks us tbh. Then maybe we‚Äôll start taking hacking more
seriously. Regardless‚Äìfrom now on we need to keep hacking Russia and other
adversaries ourselves either way. Worst case we‚Äôll just come across some of
their secret weapons and we will be better for it.


That my friends, is what it is like to be gangstalked and there is
currently no way out. They microchipped me before it ever even officially
started and the microchip is the whole reason I haven‚Äôt taken off and
gotten the fuck out of here. I still can‚Äôt fucking believe it tbh. I still
can‚Äôt believe my mom set me up for getting microchipped either‚Äìknowingly or
unknowingly. It‚Äôs not my mom tho it‚Äôs my brother. But my mom could
definitely act a little more motherly and like she is concerned about my
well being even if it risks her own well being that‚Äôs forsure. Dusty is her
freaking son after all, and she‚Äôs already lived a whole life whereas I
haven‚Äôt. Like some people only care about themselves I swear. You would
think she would realize I didn't do anything and I was friends with Dusty
up until the point when he started coming after me so nothing she doesn't
do is going to stop him from going after herself, any of her other children
or grandchildren‚Äìthe only way to stop him is if others actually help. This
is only going to get worse if others don‚Äôt help. One thing I‚Äôve learned
forsure throughout all this is I got my willingness to stand up for what's
right from my father. Some of my other siblings have that mentality as
well‚Äìbut not all of them.

P.s. The hackers are the only ones who know literally everything‚Äìeveryone
else seems to only know their part in it and that seems deliberate. They
literally treat everything like they are securing a computer system. (i.e.
they apply the ‚Äúminimum necessary rule‚Äù to even their criminal operations)
All you have to do to get to the bottom of this is arrest my brother.
Seriously, arrest my brother and then offer him a deal to get less jail
time and I‚Äôm sure he could tell you literally everything. Dusty doesn‚Äôt
have much to lose himself so I‚Äôm sure he would talk under the right
circumstances. Like he doesn‚Äôt have kids he‚Äôs got to worry about being
retaliated against or anything like that. If he did he wouldn‚Äôt be doing
all this shit to begin with. My brother literally is the key to all of
this. If you can force him to turn on all these people we‚Äôd be set. The
hackers have even indicated to me he‚Äôs the leader of this sect so you
should really pursue Dusty on murder of my family charges if nothing else.
He's also likely critical to both the nanotechnology and
infrasound/ultrasound. I don't even want to know how many people he's
murdered or manipulated others into murdering at this point tbh.


If It Helps

I specifically recall my brother Dusty frantically waiting for a package
when we lived at our dads house previously while my dad was still alive.
Asking everyone if they had seen a package or not.

Seriously you guys he‚Äôs a serial killer‚Äìhe fully intends to kill me. He has
been making my life miserable daily until he does. In part to avoid him
going to jail later because I‚Äôm the best person to testify against him as
I‚Äôve been saying this whole damn time. If you guys still aren‚Äôt all over
him by now then it looks like he‚Äôs going to get away with murdering his
whole family. I‚Äôve done literally everything in my power to help you guys.
Yea it got more complex when the Russia part came up but it‚Äôs the truth. It
makes the most sense. He sought out Russia to lessen the chances of him
personally getting busted himself. It is what it is. Now it‚Äôs just a matter
of what if anything our law enforcement is going to do about arguably the
most ruthless notorious criminal mastermind killer in all of Utah. This has
got to be one of the biggest cases in all of Utah. This isn‚Äôt gang on gang
crime‚Äìit‚Äôs my brother killing his whole family and likely many others‚Äìand
colluding with Russia in the process. And hacking our whole damn
infrastructure. Like what else do you want? My brother is the guy you hear
about who is behind causing others to go on shooting rampages. One of the
email addresses they spoofed previously on my account actually linked back
to another shooter in Logan. (The heavyhorned@yahoo.com one‚ÄìI figured you
guys would do your own investigation on it tho and for all I know that
particular research of mine could be wrong‚ÄìI got mixed signals on
researching that one‚Äìbut regardless this shit is super concerning in and of
itself) My brother is also the guy you hear about when you hear about
people getting microchipped. Like one of these days you are going to regret
not arresting him sooner. I‚Äôll be gone and you all will have literally no
chance at ever successfully prosecuting him at that point.

I could use your help in getting this all to stop‚Äìplease. And getting this
damn microchip out of my ear. Everyone else is too afraid to help which
should tell you something about this case‚Äôs authenticity. Like seriously
please go harder on him before it's too late. Plus, arresting my brother
will only help you with Russia. Like I don‚Äôt even see the downfall of
arresting him at this point. Worst case you can just say it was a good
intention or whatever and there‚Äôs nothing he can do about it. But I promise
you‚Äìyou won‚Äôt regret it.

These are the kind of memories my brother is so afraid of with me. He‚Äôs
gangstalking me to try and discredit me. He‚Äôs made all the people he‚Äôs
killed lives this miserable right before he killed them. Like seriously‚ÄìI
didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Just cuz I care about our country doesn‚Äôt make me
a bad person either. At least I‚Äôm honest unlike my brother. Plus, I have a
really good memory.

As of March 28, 2022 I‚Äôm Now Out of Time

I‚Äôm now out of time you guys. The attackers have managed to add something
to my water which gives me hives just by exposure to it‚Äìand that‚Äôs not even
me drinking it. Which explains how all my clothes and whatnot give me hives
lately as well. And I honestly don‚Äôt trust it. Like it giving me hives
could be the least of my worries. And so that means I can no longer even
shower if I stay here. It also means likely for the past 2-3 weeks I‚Äôve
been exposed to one of their poisons without being able to ever fully wash
it off.

Alright so I took a sample of my water today. I pretended like I was
getting in the bath then I took a sample of my water and put it in my
security deposit box along with my other important items. However, with
that said, I ended up taking a picture of what was in my security deposit
box so incase they get in there and steal something then I‚Äôll have proof
but I now get the sense they are trying to get access to my keys to take a
picture of my security deposit box keys then they plan to 3d print a
duplicate key and create a fake ID of me so that they can then get access
to my security deposit box and tamper with all my evidence without my
consent. I‚Äôm pretty sure I heard someone in my house earlier and I think
that is what they were up to‚Äìthey were trying to get access to my keys I
left in the other room to take a picture of my keys again is what they were
doing. (Only this time they were targeting my security deposit keys)

The problem is I store stuff like some of my backups and whatnot in my
security deposit box, along with this water sample from today and whatnot.
So theoretically they could get in there, erase my backups, replace the
water, without them really ever even technically ‚Äústealing‚Äù anything.
Meaning they can tamper with all the evidence and it would be hard to even
know they did.

How can I possibly keep anything safe from these guys? Like seriously? How
can I keep anything from them? I wouldn't be surprised if they even went so
far as to hack my bank's camera systems so that there is no trace for when
they do go in there and access my security deposit box illegally. They hack
literally everyone else so why wouldn‚Äôt they hack them too? If they haven‚Äôt
hacked my bank already then it is definitely now a target. Cache Valley
Bank on 100 N is the bank I‚Äôm referring to.

I told you these guys constantly evolve based on the latest intel. It's not
fun to go up against any entity like this, that‚Äôs for damn sure. Russia‚Äôs
whole performance in Ukraine is exactly that‚Äìa performance. They haven't
even taken out Ukraine‚Äôs internet as if they want the whole world to see
their atrocities. None of what Russia is doing in Ukraine or anywhere else
for that matter can be taken at face value. Why would they not try to keep
all their atrocities hidden? My answer to that is because they want people
to react because they are actively cataloging all of the resistance‚Äìlike
I‚Äôve been saying. But then again, my brother would know a hell of a lot
more than I do..

My constraints for keeping shit safe/secret are as follows. Essentially
they have my home and car rigged to be able to ‚Äúwatch‚Äù me and they do so
literally 24/7 these days‚Äìusing infrasound and electromagnetics and
nanotechnology primarily‚Äìand then they ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to whatever the hell I do
or say 24/7 too‚Äìusing any microphone around that they have hacked. Their
damn microchips themselves might act as a microphone too, idk, I haven‚Äôt
figured that part out yet. I know it can act as a standalone GPS device
somehow.

Plus, any key I have they can just take a picture of and 3D print a copy of
it. Any ID I have they can just forge it. Any combination I have they can
just ‚Äúwatch‚Äù me use it and then simply replicate it later. Any friend I
might give a key to they can just do the same with them‚Äìlike believe
me‚Äìnobody is as secure as I am after all this and they still get through.
I‚Äôd almost have to give it all to the police or something before they
tamper with it.

And even then I can‚Äôt give the police things like my dog‚Äôs ashes to keep
safe.

I hope the police will take my evidence from me and treat it with the level
of importance it deserves. Whatever substances they use aren‚Äôt going to be
easy to trace, just because that is how they operate, but ideally we‚Äôd
simply store everything until a later date when we actually have a better
idea of what to test for exactly.. (Like I was doing)


As of March 30, 2022Be on the lookout for possible Russian EMF satellite
targeting US

Be on lookout for a Russian satellite targeting the following address in
the US with an emf:

1235 Smithfield Canyon Rd

Smithfield, UT 84335

United States

https://maps.apple.com/?address=1235%20Smithfield%20Canyon%20Rd,%20Smithfield,%20UT%20%2084335,%20United%20States‚â™=41.848250,-111.806250&q=1235%20Smithfield%20Canyon%20Rd&\_ext=EiYpwH+pRgDsREAxozWkZPzzW8A5PlXPoibtREBBuXw80DbzW8BQAw%3D%3D&t=m


They have no other real good way to emf me here really so I‚Äôm assuming they
could be using a Russian satellite to do it just now. I‚Äôll be here the rest
of today and part of tomorrow.

This is how I think they must have busted them the first time cuz I
remember seeing a black hawk helicopter fly over my house when they were
still investigating it with the first detective Escobar and shortly after
that their investigation concluded.

It‚Äôs not nearly as bad only having the satellite emf me and only having to
protect from one direction really tho that‚Äôs for sure.

If I‚Äôm right about the satellite then we should de-orbit the damn thing(s).
I read we have the capabilities to do so now. (Without creating a bunch of
space junk) Or something. Maybe not deorbit it cuz that would start a space
war but we should definitely do something is all I‚Äôm saying.

Last I checked we aren‚Äôt experimenting on Russian citizens and murdering
Russian people with our satellites‚Äîso they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to do so
with theirs either.

Also, arrest my brother already please. It really is the least you could
do. You won‚Äôt even piss off Russia by doing so cuz he‚Äôs an American
citizen. He‚Äôs caused enough grief in this world as is already. Keep in mind
tho they have advanced insight into what the police are doing‚Äîbut I‚Äôd
suggest you arrest him before he bounces to Russia‚Äîthat‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do if I
were you.

Actually sorry this may not be a satellite it may just be them stroking the
atmosphere to create infrasound that goes my direction. My bad. Can you
imagine having nothing better to do than to see how much you can annoy your
brother each and every day? Like what a life right? What a life that must
be. No wonder no girls like my brother.

The damn microchips are the key to it all. Without those they couldn‚Äôt
precisely locate me to do all this shit to me. They have to have precise
location of your head in particular to be able to do all this to you. Be
careful in getting your vaccinations folks‚Äîlike seriously‚Äîbe careful. I‚Äôm
not advocating not getting them, I'm just saying be careful when you do. If
the needle is bigger than you remember‚Äîrun the hell out of there. And if
you think you might be hacked or if you think whomever sets up your
appointment for you might be hacked‚Äîthen set up another appointment and in
person next time or just go in and get your shot randomly in person and at
a random location‚Äînot smith's marketplace in Logan‚Äîit‚Äôs simply not worth
the risk of having some corrupt Russian proxy nurse inject you with these
damn things‚ÄîI assure you. There‚Äôs no real good way of getting them out once
they are in you either. Speaking of that, I‚Äôve been meaning to get you the
nurse's name who did this to me. I‚Äôll get you those records soon...

I aim to bring every single one of these guys to justice‚Äîmy brother
especially. This whole Ukraine ordeal has only helped in making that
actually plausible. Thank you Ukraine for your help, I‚Äôm sorry Russia
dragged you into this too.. I feel for you. Together we will make it
through.

I think I need a shield you guys. An ef/rf/emf shield. Kinda like my
infrasound jammer but an electromagnetic field jammer‚Äîan all in one device.
I‚Äôll even have to patent it one of these days lol. I‚Äôve been learning more
and more each and every day. Like for instance, I think their mobile car
crew and neighborly emfs are actually hooked up to some kind of an antenna.
So they just pump a bunch of oscillating amplified electricity into a
directional antenna is how the emf/ef/rf ones work I think. (The non
satellite versions) Then I read something about them stroking the
atmosphere just right to create the infrasound, but they‚Äôve also shown me
they use these advanced algorithms and can create crazy sound effects from
literally any speaker system as well. Is it sine wave Algorithms?
Algorithms that build on each other to where the infrasound waves literally
like build up and start resonating and bouncing off of literally everything
in my whole room‚Äîincluding other infrasound waves‚Äîit‚Äôs nuts. They‚Äôve even
done it from my own speakers previously when they hacked my phone when I
was playing my own infrasound to try and counter them‚Äîthey ended up using
my own speakers against me. But yea, either I need some type of specialized
shield emitting device or I need to just figure out a way to disable these
damn microchips‚Ä¶

I wish I had some device where I could actually visualize all these
different waves they are producing and precisely where they all originate
from. Something like that probably costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

P.s. I‚Äôm working on moving all this content to git including the version
history up to this point. Have you seen that spycraft show on Netflix? I
just started watching it. That‚Äôs exactly the type of shit they are doing to
me‚Äîlike to the T. Just everything about that show is what they are doing to
me‚Äîit‚Äôs nuts. You would think I‚Äôm a government agent or I run a government
embassy or some shit. Sometimes they make me feel like I am Superman or
something. Cuz who else besides Superman would warrant this much time and
effort and sophistication? That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. I even bought a Superman
necklace/dog tag since as a result. ;) (it doubles as a way to throw off
some of their targeting of my head with electricity whereas it‚Äôs made of
metal)


P.s. If anybody asks‚Äîanonymous has no ties to the us government. Putin is
trying to blame the anonymous hacks on the us government. He‚Äôs even setting
them up to frame them for killing Russian citizens. This is what Russia
does regularly. Regardless, it‚Äôs essential to keep any link between
anonymous and the US government ambiguous. To be clear, I don‚Äôt even know
whether anonymous really does have ties or not to the US government‚ÄîI just
know how the game is played so to speak just from me watching how Russia
does it‚Äîthat‚Äôs all. The whole reason it works for Russia is because they
never admit it‚Äîeven tho we all know their hackers really do have ties to
the Russian government‚Äîliterally everyone in Russia will become a Russian
agent if their government so chooses it will help Russia‚ÄîRussia monitors
everything after all. Plus I can see Russia is setting up the ground work
in various forums, social media sites, etc‚Äîto both make that link and to
frame anonymous for doing horrendous things. I personally think anonymous
and the US government should have at least loose ties‚Äîfor dicey situations
just like this‚Äîbut if so‚Äînever admit it. Russia is now trying to do what I
said recently which is to hold all parties accountable when any singular
party does something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. And they are putting in the ground work to be
able to do so successfully. (Via their planting such ideas that anonymous
and our government are one in the same in our information ecosystem, aka
using communications warfare) So it‚Äôs important we counter that notion at
this time anyway. There is seriously something up with Russia and our
hackers like I said. They could be banking on this link they are setting up
between anonymous and the US government. To be clear, I‚Äôm not even a member
of anonymous. I made a video just for fun but anyone can do that and plus I
never promoted it. In reality, my scope of anonymous consists of me just
reaching out to them and giving them my opinion on various subjects, asking
for help, similar to what I did with our government once my bro started
trying to kill me. Like that doesn‚Äôt make me an anonymous member or a US
agent does it? I don‚Äôt think so. Plus neither ever even actually talks back
to me‚Äìthey only listen. (I think, which is honestly smart‚Äìkinda like these
Russian hackers never actually talk back to me‚Äìsignals are the key‚Äìquick
side note, wanna know how the Russians do ‚Äútalk‚Äù to me? By changing songs
up in my playlist, or at least they used to before I first reported it‚ÄìI
would say I miss those times but everything they do is psychological in
nature so I really don‚Äôt) Anyways, my bro must actually be pretty high up
in the kremlin tbh cuz it‚Äôs as if they are trying to use ME and this very
document to start a war in a way. My bro seems to have access to some
pretty high level stuff too. Russian satellites and whatnot, he almost
seems to drive some of their operations around here. Plus, it‚Äôs as if
Russia‚Äôs whole ordeal has a ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù ‚Äútheme‚Äù to it‚Äîas well as a ‚Äúhacking
theme‚Äù to it‚Äìon multiple levels. Nevertheless, I don‚Äôt want them to use me
to start a war‚Äînot unless any war is on our country‚Äôs own terms. This shit
is scary you guys, not going to lie.

I can now see why Joe Biden is so reserved. I think it‚Äôs called ‚Äúgame
theory‚Äù. Essentially it‚Äôs crucial you are not seen as the country who
starts any war pretty much. There really is some high tech communications
warfare going on right now as we speak‚Äîwith the end game being full blown
cyber war at the very least from what I gather. Russia is essentially
‚Äúusing‚Äù anonymous in a way to try and kick off a cyber war in my opinion.
And Russia will happily kill its own people for that cause.

Another thing we are up against right now is the January 6 investigations
coming closer to the end. Any persons that may be criminally liable might
be highly motivated to work against our government at this time.

It‚Äôs extremely worrisome that Russia is seemingly targeting all our
citizens with all their hacking right now too because they are able to
essentially then mine tons of tons of datapoints from each voter to later
use to manipulate those voters in elections if nothing else. It‚Äôs
essentially ‚Äúweapons grade‚Äù communications or psyops. There‚Äôs another show
I watched on netflix called something like ‚Äúthe great hack‚Äù or something
which was about cambridge analytica and all the illegal Facebook data they
mined in 2016‚Äìthat explains the above point in great detail. And that was
just relating to facebook data alone. We are talking about the Russians
possibly gaining full control of ALL of each and every person‚Äôs accounts
plus ALL of their friends accounts‚Äìnot just Facebook but everything‚Äìwith
all these Russia hacks via just sending a simple text or email‚Äìand it
propagating to their routers and their friends routers and hacking
literally all of their devices. And that‚Äôs even an optimistic outlook to
all this. Worst case scenario they could legit start like either
microchipping all the resistance or imprisoning them somehow, idk how yet;
I don‚Äôt even know what they have planned beyond just cataloging them all at
this time tbh. My brother would know tho ;) But it‚Äôs not just companies
that need to watch out is what I‚Äôm getting at‚Äìit really is normal people.
Russia exploits the fact that there is no legit intrusion detection systems
protecting normal household networks, and they get into corporations
through that means. (They get into corporations through the
people/employees//homes they exploit‚Äìeven if the corporation has stellar
security‚Äìguess what? They can simply exploit an employee through their home
network and threaten to give up dirt on them and get those people to do
what they want them to do) In going after the citizens themselves rather
than the corporations directly, it gives them multiple added benefits such
as the ability to stay hidden, the ability for their 0day malware to remain
0day malware for a long period of time, the ability to exploit things that
require human intervention by corrupting people, and the ability to
manipulate people in elections.

As of April 2, 2022

You guys this is not ideal. The damn vaccine cards don‚Äôt even show the
nurse‚Äôs name that gave me the vaccine. If any pharmacy or doctors office
had more than one person on duty giving vaccines then it makes it harder to
be able to identify who microchipped who. I can say the lady who did it was
a middle age I think blonde lady‚Äìthe same lady gave me both shots. But
these vaccine cards really should name who gave the shots to enable direct
accountability in situations like this. Maybe if the vaccine cards required
their names then this never would have happened cuz the nurse would have
been too scared.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z3hisev1Rom25BeYQ8zlebz6EOsSFXyg/view?usp=sharing


We really need to start emphasizing protecting our citizens in terms of
cyber security you guys‚Äìnot just corporations‚ÄìI‚Äôm not joking. Russia has
already been exploiting us since the Ukraine war started‚Äìthey just exploit
individual people directly and then use those people to exploit the
corporations. How else do you think they get into corporations to begin
with? Even if the corporation has stellar security‚Äìguess what? They can
simply exploit an employee through that employee‚Äôs home network and
threaten to give up dirt on them and get those people to do what they want
them to do within that person‚Äôs corporation to also exploit the
corporation. That‚Äôs by far the best way to do it from what I gather.
Because then it also shields the Russians from direct accountability
themselves, cuz it adds another layer. And it‚Äôs virtually fail proof.
People are the weak link. And you guys haven‚Äôt even reported it‚Äôs been
happening yet which is a huge green light for them to continue. Seriously
if we got this figured out then Russia would stop their damn war in Ukraine
in my opinion‚Äìor at very least they‚Äôd stop being so brutal. If we figured
this out we might actually save our damn country as well tbh. Our
adversaries getting all this data on all our citizens now could have huge
consequences on our future for years to come. Sometimes I feel like we are
stuck in the past or something as a country. We never think outside the
box. We don‚Äôt seem to experiment with very many next generation warfare
tactics/techniques‚Äìand we don‚Äôt even officially recognize next generation
warfare techniques are being used to drastically undermine us. We just keep
upgrading our conventional military and we never seem to adapt to the
latest threat landscape. Nukes are essentially no good at maintaining world
order nor is our conventional military when it‚Äôs a fellow nuke holder that
is causing all the havoc, we should have known this a long time ago and
started spending some of our humongous military budget on some of these
other techniques.

All this outrage Russia is causing right now is an excellent way for them
to infect tons and tons of home networks btw. Who knows, they might have
even come after me in part because I‚Äôd be a good benchmark for them in what
they could realistically expect from a better-than-average home network.
Meaning whereas they have now gotten past everything I‚Äôve tried in regards
to cyber security within my own home network‚Äìthen the likelihood they could
get past 99 percent of the remaining home networks is actually really high.
I‚Äôve tried everything you guys. Now I‚Äôm too hacked to even be able to try
anything further tbh. Like 98 percent of the tools out there don‚Äôt catch
shit from a foreign intelligence agency. Also, it makes it so their 0days
can remain 0days for a hell of a lot longer if they approach it all that
way. Just a thought..

I found a way to be able to tell if they get into my safety deposit box or
not for the time being btw. I got some single-use locks or seals that each
have their own unique number on them then I made them even more unique by
engraving/writing on them‚Äìjust incase they could go and buy similarly
numbered single-use locks on amazon. Then I added 2 of them to my security
deposit box securing all my evidence. So not only do they now have to take
a picture of my key, 3D print it, create a fake ID, hack my bank‚Äôs camera
systems, and risk going in there, but they also have to try and recreate
these exact same engravings on the exact same numbered single-use locks‚Äìin
order for them to get anywhere near my evidence without facing bank robbery
charges essentially. So yea, that‚Äôs a plus. But to be clear‚ÄìI want most all
that stuff in my safety deposit box going straight to the police if/when I
am killed‚Äìwithout tampering.

See here for what the single-use locks on my safety deposit box should look
like:

Still figuring out microchips.

Still figuring out tunnel.

Still figuring out water poisoning situation.

Still figuring out how to ultimately protect myself from their targeting me
at nighttimes trying to ‚Äúbake‚Äù me and give me cancer, etc, etc.

I can‚Äôt refinance my house at this time thanks to the attackers causing me
to not have two recent prior pay stubs to provide the lender.

Still figuring out how to get the hell out of here and where to go and how
to get away from them.

Still figuring my trustee out‚ÄìI almost had a new trustee‚Äìbut I think I‚Äôm
going to find another one that is a little cheaper and a little more
responsive. I really need to find someone who won‚Äôt be corrupted simply
based on their religion or anything else and who knows computers and
security.

I asked Paul for money to rent out a ground penetrating radar device
recently, still awaiting his response. I honestly feel really good about
this one, but I don‚Äôt want to risk being delayed again until they can come
up with some other way to get around my attempts to prove what they are
doing to me‚Äìlike what I suspect happened with the bug sweep. The delay
essentially just bought them time to remove their devices from my home‚ÄìI
swear to god my brother has direct control over my trustee. I‚Äôve suspected
this time and time and time and time again for some time now. Meaning if I
were to die‚ÄìI can‚Äôt even have confidence all my evidence will actually get
back to the police untampered. (Imagine that)

Don‚Äôt you guys see how the Russians can corrupt a whole society one person
at a time using hacking? And how they can turn supposedly ‚Äúreligous‚Äù people
into accomplices to murder just like that? All out of concern for people‚Äôs
own well-being/pocketbooks and utilizing psychology? But in reality, if
religious people truly believed in their religion they would never let
anyone manipulate them into being accoomplices to murder in the first place
cuz they would realize they are going to hell as soon as they do allow
someone to manipulate them in that way. I‚Äôm not even religious and I don‚Äôt
even cross that line myself for fuck sakes‚Äìjust out of an abundance of
caution incase the religions are right. It‚Äôs called having morals and
values.

Screw hacking organizations‚Äìhacking individuals and households gets them
way further towards their ultimate goals anyways.

Hasn‚Äôt anyone ever heard of a conflict of interest around here? Like all I
can say is I hope all this is just contained to Utah because if this is the
case across the whole country then this country is honestly screwed. Our
adversaries have managed to make corruption seemingly systemic in a matter
of what, 5 years? Screw being great, they‚Äôve made killing cool again. And
people would rather just give up and go to hell vs actually trying to do
something about it? These manipulator people literally worship satan you
guys. Like how far from your religion can you get? I seriously don‚Äôt get
it.

In addition, the Russians are controlled by the Chinese as stated
previously, everyone who concedes to their manipulation is essentially
conceding to both the devil and China‚Äìjust fyi. It‚Äôs the truth. China even
helped in hacking Ukraine leading up to the Russian invasion. Plus Russia,
China, North Korea, and Iran have had a hacking alliance since at least
2012 that I'm aware of‚Äìand that‚Äôs how all their manipulation is done‚Äìit‚Äôs
literally all based around hacking. Meaning any Russian asset is also a
Chinese asset as well because they work together on hacking.

Btw I‚Äôm registered as a Republican, so don‚Äôt try and excuse any misdeeds
away in your head on you being at war against me either. I‚Äôm just more of
an Evan Mcmullin/Mitt Romney type republican over a Donald Trump
republican. Good luck explaining that to your maker is all I can say.

If people would just be honest with themselves and be honest with everyone
else and actively try and help people like me who are trying to do the
right thing then this would all be over with already. I can think of a
million different ways to secretly talk to the police or fbi absent this
damn microchip. I know for a fact they haven‚Äôt penetrated the fbi. Meaning
everyone who doesn't have a microchip and who isn‚Äôt being emf-d daily
should be able to do the right thing and actually help our country without
them having to fear repercussions. Or better yet, you can just be like me
and just do the right thing regardless of potential foreign adversary
repercussions‚Äìit‚Äôs a foreign adversary for christ sakes‚Äìthis isn‚Äôt normal.
Even I know there are all kinds of church gospels on that very topic‚Äìon
doing what‚Äôs right even when it‚Äôs particularly difficult.

These guys get their power through all their manipulation. Without all the
people allowing them to manipulate them‚Äìnone of this would be possible.
Meaning anyone that succumbs to their manipulation and plays a role in any
way is technically guilty of all the crimes these guys are carrying out
which banks on that manipulation‚Äìincluding but not limited to their
murdering of me. (And that‚Äôs just not even being involved in any direct
way‚Äìwhich some are) And I promise you‚Äìthey are indeed murdering me. They‚Äôve
likely already taken decades off of my life at the very least and they
don‚Äôt plan to stop until they succeed‚Äìand they can‚Äôt do it without your
help.

It‚Äôs a slippery slope, that‚Äôs for damn sure. I‚Äôd rather go down knowing I
did what‚Äôs right than go down helping satan. At least then, if the
religions are right‚Äìthen I won‚Äôt be forsaken to hell for the rest of
eternity. And who knows, maybe I‚Äôll even help save this country through my
brave actions. Plus, I don‚Äôt want to let our forefathers down, I personally
really like our constitution. Just because some of your friends might be
corrupt doesn‚Äôt make it okay for you to be corrupt either.

Being corrupt isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcool‚Äù in any way. It‚Äôs more like a disease that
spreads if left unchecked. Nobody seems to think about our children or our
children‚Äôs children‚Äìand how what they do today will inevitably affect their
lives and their freedom. I‚Äôd be willing to bet most people‚Äôs kids would be
willing to do the right thing.

As of April 3, 2022

The attackers always step up their targeting of me when they know I‚Äôm
thinking about finding another trustee or redoing my own personal trust
like I am now thinking again just fyi.

As of April 7, 2022

I just wanted to add an additional thought to one of my recent posts real
quick, because I really do feel it is really important for our country and
our ally‚Äôs countries to recognize and look out for.

Russia/my brother‚Äôs suspected targeting of our citizens themselves rather
than actual corporations as of late, in relation to all their recent
hacking, their suspected targeting of our citizens or home networks
themselves as opposed to only targeting corporation‚Äôs networks gives them
multiple added benefits/advantages such as:


 -

 the ability to stay hidden by adding an addition proxy layer for
 investigators to have to go through in our adversary‚Äôs ultimate hacking of
 all our corporations/infrastructure, (The investigators literally have to
 track their way back through citizens‚Äô computers and find the malware on
 those computers and then track that back to any command and control server
 which could be behind all kinds of proxies and whatnot itself‚Äìplus, all
 their hacking of individuals is also how they apparently communicate with
 their targets by creating and utilizing learned signals over time‚Äìwhich
 would be a lot harder to pull off in the context of them just targeting an
 individual organization)
 -

 plus it gives them the ability to hack a person‚Äôs whole social network
 at a time and develop a profile of each person individually through their
 friend networks, (essentially building an ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù database)
 -

 perhaps most importantly it gives them the ability for their 0day
 malwares to remain 0day malwares for a lot longer durations of time,
 (whereas most if not all home networks DO NOT have the capability to truly
 detect and report NEW 0day malwares of the caliber any foreign adversary is
 using to the rest of the world‚Äìwhich is huge in and of itself‚Äìit
 essentially allows their malware to remain effective for much longer
 periods of time and it therefore allows them to use their 0days against a
 lot more people)
 -

 plus exploiting citizens themselves over corporations gives them the
 ability to actually exploit things within corporations that require direct
 human intervention, (i.e. corrupting people rather than just robots allows
 them to do a bunch more stuff than they could otherwise do; it honestly
 makes me think of edward snowden for some reason and it makes me question
 whether or not they got him to somehow give up all our secrets by first
 exploiting him somehow‚Äìit‚Äôs definitely a possibility)
 -

 and then targeting our citizen‚Äôs home networks themselves rather than
 corporation‚Äôs networks also gives them the ability to be able to actually
 manipulate all our citizens later in our elections through the social
 profiles they create on each person‚Äìeither as candidates or as voters‚Äìwhich
 is also huge from an adversarial point of view. (Because they are then
 forming both a ‚Äúprospective candidate‚Äù and/or ‚Äúprospective voter‚Äù profile
 on each person rather than just a ‚Äúcorporation‚Äù profile essentially‚Äìit goes
 back to the cambridge analytica type manipulation except on steroids in
 this case essentially‚Äìbecause their access to any person‚Äôs data literally
 has no bounds in this case)


We really need to look out for our adversaries specifically targeting our
citizens in regards to hacking is all I‚Äôm saying. Because I‚Äôm pretty sure
that is what they are now doing and have been doing for a while now‚Äìthey
are honestly seemingly corrupting our whole society and just think‚Äìthey
could be gathering data now that they could then turn around and use to
gain influence over candidates potentially decades from now‚Äìwhich just
creates a wicked feedback loop‚Äìand they do it all in ways that are all
super difficult and time consuming to investigate and prove. Moral of the
story is targeting home networks is a heck of a lot easier than targeting
organizations from their point of view. And it‚Äôs a lot more discrete too..
And as a home user it‚Äôs almost impossible to stop because nobody really
offers or utilizes services capable of detecting or stopping it on a
non-corporation level.

This gets to the root of why I‚Äôm ultimately so concerned for our country
tbh. It gets to how our adversaries I think have been corrupting our people
to begin with. (Well this and all their social media communications warfare
manipulation, well that and a certain leader that may or may not have been
a Russian proxy‚Äìor a certain leader who at very least was unknowingly
helpful to our adversaries strategy of isolating and dividing us as a
nation to begin with) Literally everything else spawns from this root. My
brother wouldn‚Äôt even be able to do any of this to me without all that
pretty much‚Äìor at least he wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as effective without their
seemingly strategic targeting/manipulation of our social networks I
wouldn‚Äôt think.. It‚Äôs scary. Some people don‚Äôt see how hacking can be such
a big deal‚Äìbut it really is‚Äìand this is how.

I really hope if nothing else than I really hope someone will look into
this notion and take it seriously because doing so really could make all
the difference in this world.

Recent Triggered Alarms

As for the most recent triggered alarms‚Äìit seems as though the attackers
strategy is now to wear down the police by triggering multiple false alarms
deliberately at my home. I apologize you guys. They did it right after my
phone died tonight too to where I couldn‚Äôt tell dispatch not to send the
police and I was only informed of it when I got home when my base station
told me essentially. Regardless, to hopefully prohibit the attackers from
wearing you guys out gooing forward I have now changed up the settings to
only send me an alert whenever any of the motion detectors are triggered.
My apologies again. I know that‚Äôs what they are doing too. It‚Äôs like even
with a working functional alarm system they will still exploit it to make
it as good as useless pretty much.. But I think I figured out a decent
middle ground to where if my alarm is triggered now‚Äìit should legit mean a
door has been opened‚Äìunless they hack the door sensors themselves. They
triggered the one in my attic of all places. I only added it up there cuz I
kept hearing noises up there. Idk if they got direct access to my attic
from their suspected tunnel or not tbh, it could just be them pointing
their directed energy weapons at it causing the wood to creek, as I
suspected previously, and they could possibly even trigger the motion
sensor that way, idk. They like to play games like that, but I refuse to
let them. It‚Äôs just whatever.




Actually you know what? I don‚Äôt want to give them any possible leeway to be
able to toy with the police going forward, so I just turned all my sensors
to only send me a secret notification on any sensor being triggered going
forward now instead, seems how that is the second time they‚Äôve made the
police come to my house now in like 2 weeks. Unlike them, I actually care
about the police‚Äôs time and so I‚Äôd prefer just to put an end to their
toying around with everyone right now. If they have a tunnel the police
will never catch them until I find their tunnel anyways, plus I really just
need something to notify me when they get in that I can then use to report
back to here afterwards anyways, seems their ‚Äúsignature‚Äù is very much like
poisonings and whatnot anyways. (Seems they have yet to like straight up
shoot me or anything, they have pulled a gun on me once but they haven‚Äôt
shot me‚Äìyet‚ÄìI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how they roll) My security system more is
just useful as like a historical logger for me more than anything‚Äìand as a
deterrent I would hope.. It really is them triggering my alarm however‚Äìit‚Äôs
just they come in my house literally like daily anyways without my
permission through one means or another from what I gather‚Äìor at least they
try to come in daily‚Äìbut my goal is just to keep them out without them
exploiting anything including the automated alarm triggers to police
dispatch‚Äìthat‚Äôs my goal anyway--and so I‚Äôve got to just adapt and overcome
and evolve to all their latest shenanigans myself. My apologies again
regardless however. Thank you for your understanding.



As of April 8, 2022

Added pic of aforementioned led and/or led cap I have referred to in this
document a couple times previously‚Äìjust incase my brother gives me cancer
and then tries to blame it on my references to led above. (Especially
whereas there is literally zero other potential sources of cancer I‚Äôve ever
been exposed to as a software engineer by trade) Last I checked the led
vests/led caps themselves that the doctor‚Äôs office makes you wear for
x-rays DO NOT give you cancer themselves‚Äìwhat I have used to protect myself
from their x-rays/emfs is no different. Therefore all I‚Äôm saying is if they
do succeed in giving me cancer‚ÄìDO NOT buy it. I‚Äôm not too worried tho cuz
their poison shit is everywhere in my house to this day there is residual
traces of it everywhere they‚Äôve ever put it pretty much. But yea, Karie
didn‚Äôt even have any cancer in her family and she‚Äôs the healthiest person
I‚Äôve ever known‚Äìnot even exaggerating. Plus karie was from a different
mother anyways. And my fathers family also has no history of cancer nor
does my mother‚Äôs family. Plus I wouldn‚Äôt need one of these led caps if they
weren‚Äôt emf-ing me all night every night to begin with anyways‚Äîthat‚Äôs my
point.

My brother is literally quite desperate at this point from what I gather,
he‚Äôs literally giving up a lot of Russia‚Äôs secrets, whether he is intending
to or not, and he is bringing all this about our family‚Äôs shady death
history to the forefront. He is seemingly looking for any possible way out
at this point that also accomplishes his ‚Äúgetting rid of a key witness that
could totally get HIM locked up for the rest of HIS life for all HIS past
murders‚Äù plan. (Meaning he‚Äôs looking for a way to kill me right here in
Logan at the young age of 33 and still get away with it despite him knowing
him doing so is like the redest of red flags possible given my family‚Äôs
already questionable death history and given all our family‚Äôs medical
histories not aligning with cancer whatsoever essentially‚Äìif Dusty succeeds
he will have outed himself at that point in my view)

My father died here in Logan, my sister came to Logan to die after a long
tough battle with non-hodgkins lymphoma. (which normally only happens in
older people I heard, and it normally is the most easily overcome cancer)
And Dusty knows damn well that if he kills me here in Logan he is
completely and totally f-cked and yet I do get the sense that he‚Äôs risking
it nonetheless because he‚Äôs already given up so much of Russia‚Äôs secrets
already that he barely even has a choice‚Äìand he‚Äôs already spent so much
time and money on me already‚Äìbut what he doesn‚Äôt get is it‚Äôs already too
late. He‚Äôs already managed to tear apart his new ‚Äúfamily‚Äù whether he meant
to or not. One would be forgiven to think that was his goal this whole
time, because I personally can‚Äôt think of a better way for him to get all
this info out to the general public and to our government which will allow
them to counter all of it. But regardless, Dusty is a killer and he needs
to be held to account for what he has done/what he continues to do to this
day. And unlike Karie‚ÄìI personally plan to be extremely vocal as hell
through this whole process regardless of what Dusty does to me‚Äìas vocal as
I possibly can be tbh‚Äìand I plan to document what Dusty has done to me to
the bitter end so that you all can see exactly what my brother has done to
his family and what he continues to do to us‚Äìso that way it will become as
serious to YOU as it is to ME. And so that way nobody ever forgets just
what Dusty is capable of and that way Dusty will be truly be exposed for
what he really is once and for all. I plan to leave no doubt in anybody‚Äôs
mind just how much Dusty belongs in prison before I die if he does succeed
in giving me cancer. And I plan to get all his little helper buddies locked
up too. It really is the least I can do for all they have done to me.

Steel works about just as well as led to block the entire electromagnetic
spectrum btw, because steel essentially contains led/iron, and I also use
just regular steel/iron to block all their direct radiation against
me‚Äìagain don‚Äôt let them try and tell you that any steel or led or iron or
anything else I‚Äôve done to try and protect myself‚Äìdon‚Äôt let them blame me
for their killing of me essentially. Just figured I‚Äôd call it out now while
it‚Äôs still ‚Äúearly‚Äù. Cuz I know that is precisely how they think. Believe
me, I‚Äôm not dumb. But you never know what these people might be creating as
a pretext for for like the fiftieth time, I assume it will follow the same
pattern as the last forty-nine times however.. Plus, Dusty has indicated to
me that he likes to kill people or to be more precise he said to me right
after karie died that ‚Äúpeople tend to die‚Äù in ways that they fear the most,
and for whatever reason Dusty believes I fear cancer the most‚Äìand we shall
let him believe that.

Unlike Karie I know damn well who is doing all this shit to me and now I
know who apparently did it to them too and I therefore shall use any and
all precious time I have left on this earth devoted towards making sure
anyone and everyone knows the truth‚Äìso as to prevent Dusty from harming
anybody else including but not limited to any other family members of mine.
(Meaning cancer might actually prove to be a good way for me to die in this
case‚Äìcuz it buys me precious time to take you all along for the ride and it
buys me time to finish documenting everything from A to Z‚Äìit essentially is
one of the best ways to ensure Dusty and his cronies are held responsible
for what they have done essentially) And if that‚Äôs what I have to do to
protect everyone else then that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do.

I can‚Äôt believe Dusty actually thought he could kill his whole family and
get away with it tbh. Like he‚Äôs smart, book smart, but he lacks common
sense.

My Own Personal Trust‚Äôs New Amendment

P.s I signed an amendment to change up my own personal trusts trustee to my
other brother Michael Thompson today. Because Mikey is best suited to
handle the aftermath of what Dusty is doing to me‚Äìas a former police
officer himself. I still got some work to do on my trust documents however,
to make sure they are easy to read, fully lawful no matter what, and easier
than my dad‚Äôs was to understand. But changing the trustee from someone I
fear Dusty might have influence over to someone I know he doesn't have
influence over was a huge step in the right direction. I still need to
spend more time on it and better plan out who I really want to leave
everything to. And even add specific bequests and whatnot to it including
adding like the giving all remaining evidence to the police if I haven‚Äôt
already done so part. My father always liked Michael anyways.

Busted For Changing What I Wrote Just Barely

K so I just caught them deleting part of what I had originally written. I
essentially stated that Dusty has essentially poisoned me 50 or more times
now so anything I may have done to accidentally expose myself to cancer is
completely insignificant to what they have deliberately done anyways. And I
went on to say that Dusty has got to have direct access to like a Russian
biolab or something just given how they always evolve the method of
delivery of their poisons and their poisons themselves based on their
latest intel. So yea, I‚Äôm accusing Dusty and Russia of using bioweapons
right here in the United States and they didn‚Äôt seem to like that, so they
deleted that part of what I wrote and in proofreading it again one more
time after a small break, I caught the fact that that part was now missing.
But the only reason they wouldn‚Äôt like that part is because it is the truth
and they are scared how it might impact them. The facts are no person just
buying something off the dark web could ever have the sheer variety of
poisons they‚Äôve used against me at their disposal, and they for damn sure
wouldn‚Äôt be able to tweak the delivery method or base substance used within
the poison time and time again. Like most recently they tweaked it to make
it work through just simple exposure when injected into my house's water
pipes somewhere and so it would get on me and stay on me whenever I took a
bath. (Like that has got to be some serious chemistry involved) And YES I
am indeed now 100 percent confident it was my bath water that was giving me
hives for weeks recently btw. And just like a few more quick examples, they
got poisons that are seemingly meant to kill fastly, they got poisons that
are seemingly meant to kill slowly or give people cancer, they got poisons
that are seemingly meant to discredit people like by causing all these
strange abscesses before I stopped drinking my water and they even changed
out the delivery base substance numerous times previously like when they
found out I was able to actually wash their poison off with rubbing alcohol
previously. They legit changed the base of the poison out to no longer wash
off with rubbing alcohol. I will not say how I ended up getting that
particular variation off at this time, just to prevent another iteration of
it. But yea, hopefully you get my point. Dusty totally has seemingly direct
access to some biolab of some form meant to create poisons for purposes of
killing people and they are using those poisons right here in Logan, UT. To
be clear, I no longer believe my brother is just getting this shit off the
dark web. As you have seen throughout this journey, if you have read along,
I now fully believe Dusty is indeed working with Russia and/or China and I
believe he is likely funded by a Russian oligarch with his main objective
being to destabilize this local region of our country from within. But I am
fairly confident he has direct ties to the Russian intelligence services.

I also had stated something just barely that they deleted about how I
probably need to get a yearly check-up soon just given all the poisons
they‚Äôve subjected me to and continued to subject me to overtime, and that I
was honestly surprised that my body has held up for this long just given
how they have now poisoned me literally over 50 separate times in one form
or another.. (Whether it be on a door knob, on multiple door knobs, in my
car on my shifter, in my car on my arm rest, on my car‚Äôs door open handle,
in my car on the steering wheel itself, directly on my dog previously,
directly seemingly injected into my dog previously when at medvet, in my
house within my shelter on the sheets, on my pillow case, on my sound
proofing I surround myself with to try and stop their infrasound, on light
switches, injected into my water pipes‚Äìthat one they can deliver numerous
different poisons overtime, etc, etc. And all that was just off the top of
my head. Again--I‚Äôm not even exaggerating--they‚Äôve likely poisoned me
closer to 100 or more times tbh--50 is an extremely conservative estimate
to say the least. It‚Äôs more like 50 times where it was immediately
physiologically/psychologically disruptive to me. I also stated there IS
MOST DEFINITELY still residual poison pretty much everywhere in my home
from their past attempts. Just in trying to prove the point that any other
source they could possibly blame me get cancer from is just complete bs.

They are now playing the sounds of turbo suffering to me again as if to try
and punish me for re-pointing out the fact that they seemingly have access
to a biolab. And I didn‚Äôt even mention the numerous different types of
gasses they have used..

Regardless, I think it's about time for a yearly exam...
