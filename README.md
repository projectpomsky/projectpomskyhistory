Added all signed copies of my own personal trust and its amendments here:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zIiOn0GE\_XH8C7qF6TNbWhZ3D2U5swZJ?usp=sharing


I’ve been working on a newer version that I can feel confident it will
actually hold up in court as you can see here:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-YJGVw4Lj462hNF92ntszSPOM5rPTgL-?usp=sharing


I’m still working out the exact beneficiaries and whatnot btw. I want to
combine the one “Chase Wade Gibbons Revocable Trust” and “Pour Over Will”
essentially with a clause I found in another will template I found which
assigns a digital executor. I also changed it up to make it so there will
now be two trustees instead of just one so as to try and further prevent
any targeting and/or potential corruption. I’m also thinking about just
doing any of the charity donations as part of my will itself and leaving
them out of my trust. Technically I could just do everything in a will I
think. It’s already complicated enough as is anyways. Right now I got a
pour-over will created by Hansey Law Offices that I’ll also add the signed
version to the above folder and give it to people personally given the
nature of the hacking threat I am faced with. But tbh, the trust Paul set
up for me was completely bogus and I liked that Hansey guy because he was
essentially representing someone against Paul when I first met with
him–however as with everything lately I think Jones Simkins and that Hansey
guy might have just used the fake trust Paul setup for me as evidence
against Paul that caused Paul to settle with them and since then the Hansey
guy has acted like Paul’s not so bad after all. I find it odd especially
whereas like I specifically brought up to him afterwards that I read if I
were going to make any charitable donations to any business entity as part
of my trust/will then I’m actually supposed to include their charityId
number, as you can see in some of those draft wills THAT I PUT TOGETHER
MYSELF–however Hansey never even said anything about it after he seemingly
settled with Paul with his other client and not only that–he kept Paul’s
original trust in place and just created a generic “Pour Over Will” for me
and pretty much sent me on my way. And that’s concerning because it means
my charitable donations to entities like the CACHE COUNTY SHERIFF'S
DEPUTIES ASSOCIATION, INC. might have proved completely invalid. Meaning
they still to this day wouldn’t have gotten anything despite me supposedly
being surrounded with all these “experts” and despite this being like my
ninth iteration of thee trust Paul setup for me while trying to rely on
anyone around here’s guidance. This tenth iteration I’m doing my own
research and I’m doing away with the trust Paul setup for me. Plus it’s
just concerning because its like again somehow Dusty somehow exerted his
influence over these people to get them to settle their own fueds at my own
expense–because Dusty is completely fixated on me cuz he knows I could
result in him being locked up for the rest of his life. It’s just whatever,
I feel like that Hansey lawyer settling his case with Paul and Paul’s old
employer who fired him for “not putting his clients interests first” likely
just used the evidence I provided him, (i.e. the phony trust paperwork Paul
created for me) and he used that to gain leverage over Paul to get Paul to
settle but then whatever Paul and Dusty is hiding from me seems to have
made it so they not only settled but now none of them want the truth to
come out essentially cuz otherwise I’d think that hansey lawyer would
realize things like how scary it is that the trust document Paul created
for me it doesn’t even include a severability clause. Meaning if one part
of that trust Paul set up for me was deemed to be invalid in court–then the
whole thing could be deemed invalid and thrown out.

So now I added my own severability clause in the latest amendment I just
did but even still that trust Paul setup has been such a nightmare for me
that I still don’t trust it tbh. And it’s not intuitive at all either. I’m
still not convinced it would actually stand up to legal scrutiny which I
fully suspect Dusty will exploit if given the chance.

Compare this: (Paul/Hansey’s version – Even with my new severability clause
I just barely added because otherwise it had no hope for standing up in
court whatsoever)

You guys I’m not even exaggerating–Paul has never taught me anything even
remotely useful about taxes over 10 years–as if deliberately.

I’m not stupid you guys. Sometimes I’m just too trusting I guess given the
fact my brother is the monster he is and given the fact others actually let
my brother manipulate them into doing some pretty dark shit.



One thing I ran into just barely is the mess of trying to transfer my
shares of GFIC into my own personal trust. It turns out you got to go based
on the operating agreement. And the operating agreement is shown here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/14S-9txhHPDYbSknrtlmVlFZ3X622Gr\_h/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117949522585689688012&rtpof=true&sd=true



What I discovered is I have the right to be paid compensation of my
choosing for being a manager of GFIC. I also have the right to amend that
operating agreement. I also have the right to essentially transfer the
titles of anything in GFIC into my name. And all my assets are in GFIC
pretty much. So yea, that was a shocker.

As for how I’m supposed to transfer GFIC and it’s assets to whom I want it
to goto if/when I die, well ideally as shown here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1frhYLzLnpl5ze1nCEKIFQHZDgSTlnFUj/view?usp=sharing

Meaning I should have already made whomever I was going to designate my own
personal trust’s trustee a member just like my father did with us. Then I
would need to change up the operating agreement to make it so the persons I
choose can and will indeed become a managing member upon my passing. Doing
so allows you to split up the taxes over a number of years and save on
estate taxes that way essentially, by making it not all a lump sum in one
year–which puts it all in a lower tax bracket. The problem however is Paul
never teaches me anything about taxes–he seemingly deliberately doesn’t
ever teach me anything about taxes for whatever reason–he never has
either–even though I’ve had a relationship with him as my
accountant/trustee for over ten years now and I talk to my accountant more
than anybody. And so as with everything else in life I’ve found out if I
want something I’ve just got to do it myself/learn it myself. And this is
how pretty much my whole life has gone thus far thanks in large part come
to find out because of my serial killer brother–who only gets joy when
manipulating or doing harm to others; it’s become difficult for me to trust
anybody really anymore and for good reason cuz Dusty’s already corrupted so
many people around me.

I think I figured out the exact recipe my brother and Russia have been
using to systematically corrupt more and more of our country btw.

Read this ticket I just created on the new Evony game I’ve been playing.
It’s a lot like Age of Empires mixed with a puzzle game but it’s on your
phone. Essentially my bro and his gangstalking crew try to make anything
that is enjoyable to me no longer enjoyable to me. They really do spend all
their time on doing just that to me. But see if you can see the pattern
from this explanation of mine:

P.s. They got in my house and they poisoned me again. This time through my
open easter egg candy. It essentially makes all your joints feel like there
is sand in them out of nowhere. It was very similar to the poisons they
used to use on me only this time they did it through consumption rather
than through skin exposure. Same effect tho. I assume it’s something meant
to give me non-hodgkin's lymphoma tbh.

I know it’s from them cuz they always rub it in by repeatedly pointing
their damn energy weapons at my feet when my toes keep curling for no
reason out of nowhere, etc, etc.

I really wish someone would actually truly help me not get murdered. I
seriously don’t think I can get out of this one by myself.

My mom has raised a monster. The worst part is she won’t even admit it.

I can’t believe what Logan has become just in general and so sudden too. I
can’t believe so many people are willing to succumb to the devil's
manipulation around here. It is very cyclical in nature what they are
doing. And they end up making everyone accomplices to murder ultimately.
They essentially go after the people like me who see the hacking for what
it truly is to begin with, for how dangerous it really is, people who
aren’t particularly susceptible to corruption themselves, and then they
snag the ones that are more concerned about money than anything and that
are more corruptible in general and they just continue to further and
further corrupt them and “groom” them overtime–by ultimately making the
corruptible ones be accomplices to murdeering the non corruptible
ones–leaving our country with a bunch of corrupted people and nobody to
stand up to it. And they end up scaling this up and hacking our whole
country by simply gangstalking the non-corruptible ones like me while they
are killing them and making their lives as miserable as possible and while
they are discrediting them. And then any new contact I reach out to–they
hack; any new game I get into–they will legit spend the time and hack it at
that time so that way they are knocking out 2 birds with one stone and they
make it no fun to play anymore. (They keep changing the database on this
Evony game I’ve been playing lately to make me lose all my resources for
instance) Any person I reach out to even on linked in–they will hack them
and make it pointless for me to reach out to anybody anymore. And then
through all those new people/businesses they hack while gangstalking the
last batch–the whole process is reborn and it continues to repeat itself
until they ultimately hack everyone and everything and corrupt everyone and
kill all the non-corruptible persons essentially and make everyone else
accoomplices to all their murders. That’s my latest theory on how this all
works on a macro level anyways and how it scales.. So for instance they
just hacked the Evony game I’ve been getting into lately–and now those guys
will be faced with the same exact contemplation Rent Dynamics was faced
with originally. And whereas nobody wants to have their company
devalued–the stakeholders normally decide its best if they just act like
nothing happened despite all the evidence being extremely clear that they
are indeed hacked–but based on what they choose to do in the very beginning
will ultimately then determine whether or not they are ultimately sucked
into being accomplices to murder of their colllegues or not through
Russia’s never ending manipulation.. Once they are in your systems they can
legit ruin any day of the week for your company if you don’t do what they
want. So what do most people do at that point then? They do what they want.
And before you know it–you are an accomplice to an ongoing murder just like
that. They also use intimidation to achieve the same exact result. Silence
is quite literally violence in this case.

I shouldn’t even have to have to worry about things like my own personal
trust at this age. The so called "young" supreme court justice is at least
ten years older than me. But I have to worry about shit like that because
of everyone else's decisions and their succumbing to all the manipulation
themselves essentially. (And getting dragged down to hell themselves)

You know how it’s extra prestigious for mormons to get someone baptized
right? Yea well with these guys it’s legit the opposite. It’s extra
prestigious the more people they are able to drag down to hell essentially.
It’s like the ultimate way my brother could ever possibly dream of
undermining mormonism.

I did this today as well.

I’m just as capable as I was before despite all their harassment. However
they are in fact killing me–I promise you. Have you seen the way the
Russians treat Ukraine? Yea well that’s exactly what they are like to me. I
just wish someone would put an end to it already–or else tell me what I
need to do to put an end to it myself. Once they make everyone accomplices
to murder then there is no turning back–they own you for eternity at that
point.
